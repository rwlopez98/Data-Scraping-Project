Normally you would have to beat me with a stick to consider an AWD car, but the GTS D-AWD system allows the driver to select the default F/R torque split all the way up to sending 100% of the power to the rear axle, which is also fitted with a mechanical LSD- a feature rarely found in AWD cars. My only real gripe is that the GTS isn't any faster than my 2er. I was hoping to get something legitimately quicker- running the quarter in the mid to low twelves.Am I remembering correctly that the KIA Stinger is build on the same basic platform as the Genesis G70?And did I also hear that the Stinger has lease incentives of up to $10k?Sounds like an amazing deal on an impressive car....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38nDEvihRUkDid you hear about the Key FOB scam the dealership and Kia Finance are in cahoots on?  Basically, the way it works is they ""doctor"" paperwork behind closed doors to show 1 Key FOB returned, even if you returned two.  Then they say the reason you weren't given a return receipt in writing on the drop off date is that the lease manager wasnt' there to do it."

Up to 9.5 grand, but only if you take the specific lease through a captive program (24 month for the highest rebate) plus 1.5K conquest and whatever else may come, which can still be a great deal, considering the residual will likely be inflated vs. real value.  That's insane.  I think they overproduced big time, especially those ""GT+"" models.$12,200 lease cash for 24 months on GT2 AWD.6 trim levels have lease cash at or above $10K for 24 month terms.Many, many people are ""leasing"", then immediately buying out the lease.That's a jaw-dropping lease incentive. Amazing deal.And, that's on top of any discount you negotiate off the MSRP.However, the 24/10 residual on the aforementioned GT2 AWD is only 51%, and the MF is .00191, or 4.58%.The GT2 stickers for north of $50K, IIRC.So, if my rough math is right, say $50K MSRP, 10K incentive, additional $2K off the sticker, we get $25K residual, i.e. $542 capital payment +$120 financial payment +whatever fees and taxes = $640+fees/taxes/month with zero down, say $700-720 per month on a short term 24-month lease.  Similarly priced (MSRP) BMW 3-series (essentially entry level 330) even at higher residual (say 61%,, and lower MF, say 0.00142), if gotten with say $4K off the sticker would probably be slightly more.  However, load that bimmer up to get similar equipment and performance and you're adding at least couple of hundred bucks."

As with the Kia, the money factor equates to an interest rate around 5%, so I've considered buying out the lease to reduce the interest expense.  I may still do it, but with average rates around 3.5%, it doesn't actually save a lot of money, and I lose the risk reduction with being under a lease."

23,qbrozen,"February 21, 2020 3:51PM","benjaminhsaid:The person in this video calculates that over 10 years a mid-level Camry with an msrp of c. $28k will have ownership costs of about $54k, while the lowest cost Tesla Model 3 over 10 years will cost about $52k. The basic argument is that it makes sense in the long run financially to get a Tesla. Maybe. But one thing that isn't taken into account is that a good discount off of msrp can be achieved with the Camry, while in contrast a Tesla I think always sells for full msrp. And so that right there more than erases the difference. And if you're really looking at lowest ownership costs over ten years, my guess is that a Camry hybrid, Accord hybrid, or Sonata hybrid will beat the Model 3 by a significant margin over ten years. Hmmm. The Tesla 3 is still an awesome and appealing vehicle, but it has a highway range of 250 miles, while my Acura TLX has a highway range of over 550 miles using the EPA rating, and since I often get c. 3-4 mpg over the epa rating in the real world, my actual highway range is about 600.

They are all about playing it safe, whereas Germans are willing to take chances, make some special models for individuals with ""off-beat"" tastes, and pare it back when necessary.  I haven't seen Acura taking any real chances in their model lineup, Lexus made some efforts in high end performance range, but generally they are all a bit too oriented for the average buyer in that segment.

But the Telsa Model 3 with a few options is, as he says, a $50,000 car on which you can't get any discounts. Because of big discounts and lease incentives I paid close to $30,000 for my more luxurious TLX. With that $20,000 difference there's no way even at 2k in fuel savings a year that you'll come out ahead. And I don't drive 26k miles a year, but more like 14k. And so the fuel savings would maybe be more like $1200. Plus my guess is that by the time he gets to 100,000 miles, if he keeps the Model 3 that long, he might need to replace the batteries, which might be a c. $10,000 repair, while with maintenance and good luck the engine and transmission on a TLX might go past 200k without major repairs. The TLX has environmental costs, but so does getting rid of or trying to recycle a huge number of Tesla batteries.

49,dino001,"August 10, 2019 8:28AM","benjaminhsaid:It looks like annual sales of the Tesla Model 3 for 2019 might exceed 200,000, outselling all other ELL cars by a huge margin.https://cleantechnica.com/2019/08/10/tesla-model-3-outsold-bmw-mercedes-audi-lexus-competitors-in-2nd-quarter-in-usa-by-a-landslide/I don't think so.  It's much more likely US sales will revert closer to Q1 numbers than maintain Q2 numbers.  Anybody, who read what Tesla actually had to do to get to those Q2 numbers would know there was a lot of one-time moves, just like Q4 of last year.  I think a much more likely number is missing 200k target by a small margin.  Much more interesting to me is how many new EV buyers are left in the current market.  Those who wanted one, got it (most of them anyway) and they can pray to it, if that's their fancy.  Now it's about people like myself - I have the money, I COULD buy it even at current prices, if I wanted to.  There are aspects about those vehicles that I like and respect, but I'm not even considering it at this point.  One reason is I'm not completely convinced Tesla will be around in five years, or to be more precise, I think the probability of complete failure of the company is significantly higher than zero (in mathematical terms ""non-trivial"").  I can't ignore this in my calculus.  That's on top of the lack of energy portability that's offered in gasoline engine.  It could do well as a second vehicle in the house, but simply I have no space for two vehicles."
50,benjaminh,"August 13, 2019 6:30PM","https://loupventures.com/tesla-model-3-cost-of-ownership-slightly-cheaper-than-a-camry/""Average all-in cost per mile for a Model 3 is $0.46, compared to the Camry LE at $0.49, and Audi A5 at $0.80.""This study claims to show that a Tesla Model 3 costs less over 5 years than a Toyota Camry, which is shocking.But I don't agree with some of the numbers that were used. For instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a Camry over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my estimate). The Tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a Camry for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. So I feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the Tesla. Finally, although the Tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, I'm wondering if you own the Tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.Still, the bottom line is that the economics may possibly be shifting toward electrics, and specifically Tesla. There's no doubt that a Tesla is cheaper over 5 years than their other comparison, which was an Audi A5. And now Elon Musk says that starting next year the design life of the battery for the Model 3 will more than double:https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/If this pans out, this means that in a year or two the batteries of a Teslas Model 3 will be able to last maybe as much as 500,000 miles. The electric motors for a Tesla are already likely to last at least 500,000 miles, because well-designed electric motors are inherently longer lasting than most internal combustion engines.Plus there are no oil changes etc. For high-mileage drivers the Tesla might become a top choice, because the cost per mile driven would almost certainly be quite low.I've gone from being a Tesla skeptic to someone who thinks there might be something to this."
51,stickguy,"August 13, 2019 7:04PM","there are still limits to a full electric that would prevent me from getting one.  Unless it was really cheap (as opposed to really expensive, which they are), and I truly just needed a 2nd car for pure local duty.the problem is, they are expensive, and we can only afford one car in that high price range, and it will be the one we take on trips.  So, the train ain't meeting on this one!  No way I am taking one on say Christmas eve trip at 10 PM across the boondocks of NYS,  in usually crappy weather, and have to be trying to find a charging station in an area I would really prefer not to stop in!  Or get out to charge then sit there for 2 hours while it does.even worse if you can't afford more than say a leaf or Bolt.  Not a suitable family truckster travel car anyway."
52,stickguy,"August 13, 2019 7:38PM","well, I am not buying that logic!  driving around local means gassing up once a week or 2.  and there are stations everywhere, so if you are getting low you just swing into one, and 5 minutes later gassed up and on your way.but in the same usage, an EV would not concern me.  It really is travelling that does it.  and we don't normally stop much.  gas if going 400+ miles (well, in my car, 300 in the RDX!), otherwise just a quick pit stop for bathroom and stretch, and if eating it will be a quick food place.   and driving in rural areas at weird times, which we do, is really not going to be comfortable in an EV.Kind of a moot point anyway for us, because we can't afford the EV equivalent of the car we would like to have as our one nice set of wheels!"

But the tactile experience and sense of control isn't.  ATs are IMO much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline.They are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though.

If the driving experience was not what most of the owners wanted or expected, then you couldn't really say ""mastered"".Well, I think the ""satisfaction"" rating for A3 owners was VERY high.  Also, there's a lot of high-mile A3's running around, so they must have done something right.I would say reviews were ""mixed"" on the DSG, but a well-trained and calibrated DSG worked wonders in my opinion.

A modern D.I. turbo engine removes much of that margin to get more power from a smaller engine. It is much more highly stressed, not only structurally on things like pistons and rings and bearings but also much more sensitive to oil life, adequate cooling, etc. Adding a tune exacerbates that."

My baseline  is my MG's Smith instruments that displayed oil pressure, coolant temperature and (head for the fainting couch) an ammeter, which involved heavy wiring in and out of the instrument panel, plus the obligatory fuel level.  Anyway, they all read real stuff, and  were quite helpful in monitoring the health (or lack thereof) of my little '65 MGB as I drove it through 44 states and six provinces in the late '60s and early'70s.  I even added an oil temperature gauge, which was connected via a hollow tube to a bulb that inserted into a fitting that I had brazed into the oil pan during one of the several times I had the engine down.  This is how I learned that it takes most of an hour or two for the oil to reach a stable temperature when the ambient temperature is below zero, for those of you who wonder why your fuel mileage sucks in the winter.Good times.0.05% of the people who drive BMWs (the ostensible ""driver's car) understand a word of what I just said, let alone the rest of the driving public, who drive cheaper appliances.  Yes, I'm a pi$$ed-off old man, but my TSX has well over 150K miles on it and is still fun to drive, even though it only displays fuel level, RPM and speed (along with about 17 lighted symbols that come on during startup, and hopefully go back off).

Engines like the ecoboost in Ford pickups are not ""highly stressed"" and are not ""dancing on the razor's edge"".  And they outperform V8 engines with twice the displacement.There is a difference between factory turbo and some stage 10 kit you got of an website.  However, it is to be seen how those turbos will perform at 100K+ miles.  I read Ford vehicles suffer from reliability issues with their ""Ecoboost"" turbo engines, but I'm not sure what kind of reliability problems these are.  Sometimes it may be electrical/computer trouble that has nothing to do with engine stress, more with crappy software or even crappier electrical components.

They don't give you the option of adjusting the blaring TVs that I recall.The available snacks at the Acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. I got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest.  Was probably a fluke that I was the only one there, but it was peaceful and I got a bit of work done. I also feel like they were more focused on me and my car. When I took my wife's CR-V a week ago for an oil change the Honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. That's only a small thing, and I reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?I just checked their price list, and a regular oil change service at Huffman Acura at Oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the Honda dealer iirc. As I said, my service was ""free"", but I haven't yet figured out why the list price before they did the NC was $65. Doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably I missed some fine print somewhere.I imagine the regular oil change would be fine once my free ones are done, but I do like the idea of a little extra insurance with the extra good oil. Probably in a few years I'll be dazzled by a new model of car, but right now I'm hoping I'll enjoy driving this TLX for several years to come.

So what is this LL-01 thing that Mobil can't meet?For what it's worth, when we had to demonstrate starts at -65 deg F we used an Esso oil that met MIL-L-7808.

The ATS is an impressive luxury car that looks really good, and my local Cadillac dealer seemed to be almost giving away their last one. The last of the 2018 Volvo S60s and V60s also are potentially very good deals.If discount is big enough and you keep it long enough, the depreciation becomes a non-issue four-five years down the road, as your starting point is the lower transaction price, not the sticker.  If it’s a good lease, then the manufacturer takes the bath, not the driver.Another good advantage of buying an outgoing model is usually they work out most of the obvious flaws and kinks by then, so reliability should be at least OK. Also, the support from independent shops should be alright, as the model is well known to the technicians.  New models, on the other hand, have always risk of “teething” issues, sometimes can be quite annoying and even manufacturers can fall behind on part availability, if particular failures turn to be more widespread than anticipated."

I know some of your items (Honda sensing, CapPlay) would be on that.Yes, I did test the new Accord. Tougher call there. The new Accord is pretty impressive, but....Material quality in the TLX is a lot better than even in this generation of Accord. Here's one example that stood out for me. The dial on the steering wheel of the new Accord is clearly copied from the Acura, but it's cheap feeling, and the movement isn't particularly refined. On the Acura this control is really great in term of feel and ease of use. They look almost the same, but big difference in feel and operation. You can find differences like that in a dozen or more things  just on the inside.There's more room in the back seat and in the trunk of the Accord, but in most other ways the TLX is better and nicer.Finally, with the lease incentives on the TLX, you can probably lease the Acura for less than a comparable Honda Accord."
275,benjaminh,"October 14, 2018 7:10PM","Yeah. I slowly warmed up somewhat to the unusual looks of the Accord, but it still seems a bit strange from every angle—front, side, and back. The Acura TLX, in contrast, is just a nice looking vehicle all around. There's also a lot of variety with the TLX. My lunar silver 4-cylinder is an almost modest looking luxury car, with hidden dual exhaust and somewhat understated details. But for people who own a TLX with the V-6 there are big exhaust finishers and other details that make the car pop. For me the more restrained look works just fine, perhaps because I'm in my 50s and a college prof?"

Even though I like Acuras, the ILX seems below the competition in terms of prestige and often performance (except for the 320i). But since for just a little more than a Civic you can lease a base ILX it's arguably a good deal for bargain-minded customers who want a reliable and nice performing car with some luxury that's almost $10k less than the competition (when similarly optioned).I'm in Seattle right now, and the local Audi dealer has an advertised lease on a base FWD A3 for $350 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $3250 due at signing. The A3 is a better car in some ways than an Acura ILX, but the base ILX can be leased for $200 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $2500 das. If you can pay an extra $150 a month and an extra $750 down the A3 is a better looking car imho with better performance.

That price of 40k is for the new one. It does look like a great car. If you can stay away from most options it seems like a really good price for that level of car. A little bit difficult for me to get that any color aside from black costs $650 more, but I guess BMW has been doing that for many years—although iirc BMW at least offers white for free as well.Given how weak sedan sales are across the board, my guess is that in just 6 months or so there will be big discounts on the new S60."

306,benjaminhf,"October 4, 2018 4:08AM","But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX  with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get  more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....Finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"
307,benjaminhf,"October 4, 2018 4:32AM","stickguysaid:But, will be nice if they keep the pricing like the 4, but it has performance of the V6 which I assume is going away.Yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, Acura might not have much room to raise prices.Here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 TLX might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the Accord) they will really cut back on lease incentives. In other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the BMW 330i—although like today a TLX will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. My lease deal was almost too good, in that I could lease a TLX 2.4 Tech for less than an Accord EXL 2.4. I think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 TLX."

309,benjaminhf,"October 4, 2018 5:31PM","AcuraWatch is now standard on the base 2019 ILX, instead of being a $1300 option. On top of that they've cut the base price by $2300. And so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much Acura hopes to get some sales. The ILX is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an Audi A3, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. The base msrp of the ILX is now $25,900. Unfortunately Acura didn't put CarPlay/AndroidAuto into the base model. But for $27,650 you can get the ILX Premium which adds CarPlay/AA, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, BLIS, built-in garage door opener, etc.http://hondanews.com/acura-automobiles/releases/2019-acura-ilx-arrives-with-dynamic-new-styling-major-technology-upgrades-and-new-a-spec-treatmentSince the ILX weighs almost 500 pounds less than the TLX, but has almost the same engine and transmission, it is faster. I guess it's kind of a luxury Civic Si with an 8-speed dual clutch transmission....Nothing that I see in the press release says anything about enhanced driving dynamics, so that's probably very close to the way it was before."

Wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!My guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive.

In other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a Civic LX. But that's the best case scenario for the base model. The ILX Premium would obviously be a bit more...."
311,benjaminhf,"October 4, 2018 6:03PM","Currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 ILXs. But if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. Sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. I bet your local Acura dealer would give you top dollar for your Elantra Sport if you're willing to walk away. But imho the TLX is really the better car. I'd take a base TLX with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded ILX. If you are considering the ILX, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
312,benjaminhf,"October 4, 2018 6:16PM","By the end of December I bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 ILXs. The ILX premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. If you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. The trick is the resale on your Elantra Sport. As you know, once I said I couldn't afford the TLX and it was clear I was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 Accord suddenly increased by quite a bit. I think you might get more from an Acura dealer for the Elantra Sport than from Carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of Dec.?). They mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."

320,benjaminhf,"October 7, 2018 3:07AM","@stickguyimho the ILX you might consider is the step above the Premium, which is the Tech. The most important addition at that level is the ELS sound system. It lists for c. $29.5k. But wait for several months, or even the end of the model year, and there are likely to be big discounts and incentives.Of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than RDX SUV. My guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. Of course if you need BLIS and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34K. Still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the ILX. The related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the ILX are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new SUV."

It isn't too small, and with the Tech model, has most of the features I'd want including the ELS.  My main concern from the majority of the reviews I've read is that it has a harsh ride and is noisy, primarily road noise.  Not having driven one it maybe fine as a lot of the reviews are overly critical and the reviewers bang the same drum!From 2013 to 2015 the ILX did have a lot of road noise, but with the 2016 refresh they added about 100 pounds of insulating material and now it's fairly quiet.

Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus.Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe  a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time.

Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person.

Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so.

Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD.A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular car had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade in, but my monthly payment including taxes and everything else is $229. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450.But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this features in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while.So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.

The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had.I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class.

But I do like acceleration.When I'm coming up the freeway on ramp, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, I mean really jumps -- yeah, I like that.  Yes, I will pay extra for that.But the difference in 1/4 mile times between the Kia and the Alfa -- not going to matter in my world.  Both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.A few years back, when I was seriously considering a used Genesis, I did several test drives.  Both 6 cylinder models and V8's.  The guy who wrote the review for Edmunds said you didn't need the V8, it would only be for bragging rights.  A conclusion which I vehemently disagreed with.I alternate two daily drivers, a Town and Country and an F150 with an Ecoboost.  The Town and County is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way.  But you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and THEN it will move pretty good.  The Ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!"

My car's trip computer says 34.1 mpg for those same miles, which is obviously very close. This was for about 70% highway miles. This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?My 2016 Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what I got. Sometimes I got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.The 2018 Acura TLX 8-DCT is rated 33 on the highway—and yet I seem to be getting 36-39 mpg on the highway. I regularly seem to be getting 3-5 mpg higher than the EPA rating, which has never happened for me before in decades of checking my mpg on my cars. And this is in the hot summer with the AC on. During the Fall months, when I won't be using the AC much, seems like I'll probably do even better?Overall, I like my new TLX a lot. Really a lot. In almost every way it's better than my 2016 Accord—which itself was the best car I'd ever owned up until I got the TLX. Cars, unlike some things in life, really can get better than in the old days.The suspension is one of the things that impresses me about the TLX. It's controlled and yet comfortable, seemingly getting a nearly perfect mix of sporty and luxurious, but with a slight emphasis on the former.And the ELS stereo is excellent. I'm ashamed to say that I think of reasons just to drive my car so that I can listen to the stereo and enjoy the ride....I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground.    There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."

I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets.It has been several years since I last used a spare tire.  And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan.  I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was.  My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.It took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road Saturday, and I thought that was rather long actually.  Unfamiliarity with the mid-mounted spare, I actually had to dig out the owner's manual.  IT guys really hate to RTFM.Fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion.  This incident Saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall.

AAA response time in my area is usually about 15 minutes, although no doubt that varies. I changed maybe 4 tires between 1980 and 1995, and each time found it a challenging and annoying job. I don't really want to do it again. Because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow I don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. My wife's new CR-V has a full-size spare, which is something I haven't seen in a long time. Interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this.@stickguyit's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the TLX. Maybe those plastic trays can be removed? Not sure.

Speaking of which, do you find the TLX to be significantly quieter than the Accord and how so?  I do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the TLX without too much performance degradation...if Premium gas is recommended and not required.Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much.And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.@sda: You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. For a last generation Accord owner imho the TLX Tech a big upgrade, really a wow. I'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering.

I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go.  This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually.  The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep.   That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack.  I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did.  Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub.  I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose.  I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph....Yeah, stuff like this is why I'm never going to bother with changing a tire ever again."

My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho.

The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33.My son the engineer/computer coder said that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. Who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? I guess he has a point?

Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that's like. The TLX's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.But aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus."

430,benjaminh,"July 10, 2018 5:58AM","The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own.And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""

But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s.  My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability.  Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers.  Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far.  We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six.  Those four cylinders are still building the record.  One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines.  Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."

Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.I don't like FWD in anything larger than a Mini Cooper, so I'd go with the 330i- in RWD of course.Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before.  Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it..

Still wouldn’t throw it out of bed for eating crackers.  It’s all personal choice.Your statement is completely wrong, The 3 series has changed where it was needed, with the new B46 engine I feel it is a lot more fun to drive as the torque is lower in the rev band. The small changes to the interior and iDrive software has been an improvement."

I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day.

But the part she found oddest was when I finally figured out how to put the AC on, and the vents rotated open and close.  Just seems like a solution to a problem that did not exist, and one more thing to break (expensively).That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving...  Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste.  Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries.  Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats?  I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life!  I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm.The rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em.

The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following.  Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes.Regarding engines, everybody does strange stuff with engines today. Tripple scrollers, super/turbo charger mixes, batteries.  It's just fact of life, especially on European brands."

Just drove one, nice steering feedback, better than first intallment on F3x 3-series (improved by now, but still),  nice suspension.  Drives as well as my 328, it is a bit faster, AWD.  Looks good, too.  Lots of value.  I may be really tempted to save some money versus 440 Grand Coupe, or even 430.  Volvo always has some good incentives, or I could also take Overseas Delivery, which doesn't have them, but you get two ticketsvticket on Premium Economy with SAS (4 grand value, I know for a fact),  full concierge experience in Goetynburgh and hotel stay.  That's more than BMW's ED.Nobody thinks of Volvo in terms of performance, cause their base trims are targeting different audience and focus on family and fuel economy.  They've always had performance trims, but no marketing behind them, therefore nobody knows about those.I've heard of and looked at them briefly.  I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4.  Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor.  It just doesn't win on any specification.  And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago).  Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255.  My wife's Sportwagen has 225.  That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle.Now, I hope some auto exec doesn't read this and start a tire size war."

The TLX is the newer incarnation of that car, and with the somewhat improved appearance, I'm wondering why it seems the TLX doesn't sell anything like the '04-10-ish one did. I know it got ugly with the beak but it seems that it is at least decent looking now.Has the market changed? Are we just bored with cars now? Or is it the looks as IMHO the TLX is still not as good looking as that vintage TL. It seems those mid-year TLs were everywhere and it was a hot seller, but I don't think so any more. And the ILX seems like even more of a bomb. Poor Acura is not doing so well these days.I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.Finally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model."

Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX.  Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss.  ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly.I still like the TLX (and all of my previous TLs).  But, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers AWD and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time unique to the TL (and some Audis), isn't so unique any more.I know holding the prices on the TLX trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.Let's face it, Acura is becoming more an SUV company than a car company."

643,roadburner,"June 3, 2016 5:43AM","I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actuallyneedsa manual gearbox. For example, my 318ti(with a Turner Motorsports Conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. You simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. In contrast, my M235i makes 330 lb-ft of twist from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. It's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. If I was buying an M2 or M3 I would definitely go with a manualeverytime, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 I'm fast approaching geezer status."

On the Honda, it seemed you had to get the ""Touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive.  And, for what it's worth, the TLX may be conservative in its own right, but I think it's still more distinctive than an Accord.Having said that, the Accord is a great car - but I'd take a used TLX over a new Accord.

684,dino001,"May 5, 2016 5:25AM","Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels.  It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network.  They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts.  They essentially make a car and then try to sell it.  Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere.  It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way).  In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it.  Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it.  Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad.  But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores.  Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts.  May be convenient, but there is no pricing power.  I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too.  This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it.  They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned."

My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently.

I""m going to go with not a coincidence, and blame it on the body shop/accident rather than Audi.  That's how I'm chalking this one up, and appreciate Audi covering it without making me deal with the hassle of going back to a lousy shop.  I do realize the shop used an Audi derived OEM replacement part, but I have my reasons.I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I creased the side of my ti I took it to my local dealer's BMW Certified Collision Repair Center. The quality of the work was outstanding, and I had absolutely no complaints. Was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an Audi certified shop?Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County!  However, they were so horrible, I imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though I haven't had luck with any body shops in San Diego County yet (tried 4 different ones now).I did tell Audi that they need to immediately de-certify them.  They used to have a good reputation locally in Escondido (by San Diego), but they got bought out by Caliber Collision (the McDonald's of Body Shops) years ago.  They kept the old name along with Caliber Collision to fool people, and they still are certified by Audi to this day despite my complaints.I agree with you, they get away with shoddy workmanship because most people won't take their car back 3 times until they get it right like I did."

The driving feel was ok but not great. The engine (I assume it was a Turbo 4?) was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration.

My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there.I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size).  It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).What do I like?The transmission actually does whatIwant it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.The standard M Performance Power Kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block Chevys I drove in my misspent street racing youth. Fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.Michelin PSS in a staggered setup are standard. No run flats!The sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. It's no wonder that BMW NA is making them standard fitment in many US models; the base seats in newer BMW are only good for generating business for chiropractors.The H-K audio is good enough that I don't feel like I have to tweak it right away.Dislikes?The steering could use a bit more feel. That said, the effort and ratio(s)-Variable Sport Steering is standard-is very good.I agree with Bob Harper fromBMW CAR: the IP needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///M 235i"" graphic that illuminates as soon as you open the driver's doorThe brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden.No LSD. I will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in Comfort mode with DSC fully enabled.Track time will have to wait a few months. The 2ers first outing will be at Putnam Park- which is my ""home"" track. I'm too old to attempt to learn a caranda track at the same time. It will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the Launch Control...A couple of people asked me to compare it to the E30 M3; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original M3. However, it is very comparable to the E46 M3 in terms of handling and braking. Power in contrast, is more akin to that of the E9x M3 at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. In any event, I can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. Who knows when/if Munich will build anything RWD in this size class again?So... Is it worthy of an ///M badge? I'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that said, most everyone has forgotten that the first M car based on a production model was the E12 M535i- which boasted the M30 3.5 motor from the E24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an M body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats.

It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).What do I like?The transmission actually does whatIwant it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.Okay, need a legend here.  What does EDC and AMS stand for?Have you had enough seat time in other recent model sporty cars to judge other ""adaptive"" suspensions with the M235i?  I didn't notice hardly any change in a Lexus IS350 for example, and it had 4 different settings!  The S3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a different car, but even in a short test drive, it was a good difference.  If these adaptive suspensions don't add significant weight; I'd say they are definitely worth it as a Win Win."
745,andys120,"February 17, 2016 3:46PM","Congratulations, Roadburner on your new M235i.  An M235i convertible is at the top of my wish list and I think, like you, I'll like the size performance and features.  The resemblance to the great E46 doesn't hurt either.  Like you I've given some thought to various Mustangs but they're just to big for me.  I wonder if they've improved the weight  distribution.  My '86 5 liter  convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup.How long do you suppose it'll be before used M235s are in the $30K bracket?"

Indicator light was very specific about problem with the right side headlight low beam bulb.  Audi covered it, although there was a mention that sometimes they might like to wiggle out of paying for bulbs.I just said no owner would expect to have to replace bulbs in under 4 years or 50K miles.   They didn't try and charge me; said it was a $300 bulb.This was the headlight that was replaced by a body shop; so not original.  I""m going to go with not a coincidence, and blame it on the body shop/accident rather than Audi.  That's how I'm chalking this one up, and appreciate Audi covering it without making me deal with the hassle of going back to a lousy shop.  I do realize the shop used an Audi derived OEM replacement part, but I have my reasons.Isn't this 2 indicator errors in 2016 alone for me?  First windshield washer fluid issue, now a burned/broken bulb.  When is Audi going to learn how to make a car :P LOL.Maybe this is a sign I should join Chronic Car Buyer's Anonymous before a 3rd indicator error light comes on (besides low fuel)."

Seems counter-intuitive.I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner.  The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time.  The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K.  I never did the fronts in that time.I also just changed the rears on the my 2011 Explorer at just about 60K as well."

My S4 was fixed same day I took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank.   Can I blame this on the body shop or Audi?  I think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance Audi should have made the hoses with better clamps.Fortunately, I'm able to drive without windshield washer fluid, and the tank must have a 1/3 or 1/4 reserve below the hose lines so it still worked, was just low soon after using it a few times (tripping a warning light)."
759,m6user,"December 21, 2015 10:55AM","That 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years.  Since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so.  Heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
760,Mr_Shiftright,"December 21, 2015 1:34PM","Yeah, I would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80K. But parts do wear. Maybe the glove box door is as good at 80K as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80K.  And don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9K miles and how that affects resale value. I think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs.  Not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."

Also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items.  I mean, how many sellers would do ALL those things and then sell the car?"

I bought the car sight unseen 200 miles away and picked it up- we had it for a month and it mostly sat (less then 300 miles, so 100 miles minus the pickup) until we were planning a big east coast trip of 1200 so I decided to look under the hood and noticed the oil level was low- also noticed a leak- looked around one tire was a little low- started looking at structural stuff noticed some gaps larger then others on the front end- then found a piece in the engine bay -and googled the serial number which I found to be a lower piece of the bumper.( or older bumper) - took car on a Sunday to my local Honda dealer (huge chain) and had the service manager who also is a certified Honda tech and asked if this car should of been certified- and he pointed out 10 issues including major front end damage that would have disqualified this car from such CPO status - I was lucky he was willing to put this in writing and making my case with both Honda and the selling dealer easier in getting compensation.

It would be interesting to measure how much ""dirtier"" your engine becomes.  They're basically messing with boost, timing and mixture, so it must affect emissions in some respects.Seems like a bargain if you're only paying $10 per 1 HP.  Think of what some people spend to get 100 more HP--a lot more than $1,000 bucks.Dinan get about 50 more HP and charge $1500...

Of course we have a Lexus dealer that has a big buck chandelier hanging prominently in the customer area; and, we also have a Chevy dealer with a huge ""wall of fire"" fireplace in it as well as a sort of mini Chevy museum inside the customer area.

I could be wrong, but I also assume there are people (and I have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post.  Moreover, I also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites.  The problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking.""This is one of the key benefits of participating in an Edmund's Forum -- you may be provoked.One of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ELLPS -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not EL (entry level).  I often argue that EL pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size"").  This means a BMW 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ELLPS car (meaning I would include an M3 unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to Edmunds.)I found it difficult -- but I acknowledge other's POVs -- to consider two Acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ELLPS classification.  Likewise, I have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the A3 and A4 offerings from Audi to be considered in the same class.  Again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than MSRP or HP or torque, derived. Also, I think a certain Premium-ness is required to be in this club.Recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the A3 family, now that there is an S3 available, merits inclusion in the ELLPS category.  Folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the S3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an S4, render the S4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category.  After all, a balls-to-the-wall S3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out S4 can command $10,000 more.  Why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.Having two late model Audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the Audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet.  I may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 A8L for 24-hours while her SQ5 was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change.  Last week, my turn came in the form of an A7 (which, I must say, I was underwhelmed with).Couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hobby test drives we repeat Audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and I are very well qualified [amateur] Audi experts.With this as a backdrop, I must tell you about yet another S3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the S4.Being quicker to 60mph . . . see next post."

So I get what you are saying about the S3 vs. S4. It's not just about speed, it's also about quality and refinement.People who want speed, alone, can get a Mustang or a Subaru WRX and forget the refinement. Supposedly you go to Audi for some luxury and refinement as well. So yes, the A3/S3 seems a bit like a cheapening of the brand, just like the new baby Mercedes. Moving downscale to try and get a different audience, but in the long term do these types of vehicles damage their brands, and are they really luxury (even entry level) any more?"

I posted this over in CCBA as well...I was prowling my BMW dealer's used car lot today and found an Estoril Blue 2013 F30 335i M Sport. At first I thought it was the xDrive automatic that they have had a bit of trouble unloading, but it turns out that this is a one owner local car that was just traded- and-incredibly-it's RWD and has a manual transmission. It also has most every available option, including M Sport brakes as well as the M Performance aerodynamics. Don't know the price, mileage, or CPO status, but the carmaybe worth considering.  It's nowhere near as quick as I'd prefer, but that can be fixed easily enough. I had whittled my choices down to a 2013 Boss 302, a new Mustang GT Premium with the Performance Package, and the new WRX STI. Now this shows up to possibly muddy the waters."

Have you owned one?  I would put the Genesis sedan against the 5 series and E class, same size, just as quite is not quieter, ride is supple, standard equipment is greater then both of the Germans, just because it's built in Korea doesn't mean it's not a luxury car. In fact no one answer my question, when it comes to price, and which price we going to use to determine if the car is a luxury car.  You think car maker determines this.I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example:  Tissot makes/markets watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.It is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).It is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000.  Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.Tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches.  A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what I'm referring to.  The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis.  The market perceives what it perceives.  And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko,""Perception is Reality.""Dimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.It, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].Similarly, the Toyota Avalon isn't a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason.  My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc's) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don't for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches.Genesis' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW's.  The market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.Maybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that.  Perhaps, however, Genesis will -- eventually -- come to be perceived as a Premium Car.Time(pieces) will tell."

Before I retired the first time, had to drive econoboxes due to finances and family situation...raising our kids. Now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the CUV route back in December of 2013 and bought a mid-line Hyundai Tucson. Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good.Luckily, I don't worry or care about what others think about what I drive or where I live. Sure I would've liked to have bought a nicer vehicle like the A3 but didn't want to live beyond our means like so many folks do and I drive too many miles to lease.

If you like the Audi, BMW or Mercedes BRAND, you like the brand, other's opinions are of tertiary importance.Of course when I see a Toyota with TRD on it, I see ""turd,"" and I just can't imagine ""what were they thinking?""I guess the phrase, to each his/her own, leaps to mind, too.Funny, that's also what I see with TRD. I wouldn't pick that! (not that I want a pickup anyway).In regards to my original Mazda 3 comment, I'm just kind of a value buyer and to me Mazda is what Honda used to be - sporty and high value. To me a fully loaded $30K or so Mazda 3 (what I categorize as ""a cheap car that feels nice"") would provide the driving dynamics and still luxury interior and features that would be more pleasing (to me) than a much more stripped A3 at a similar price that is ""a nice car that feels cheap"".I've owned an Audi in the past and to me the A3 is just a bit too downmarket for the brand. At the time I bought my A4 with a 6 cylinder, sport package, manual tranny, in 1998, the A4 was the ""value choice"" as compared to the BMW 3-series of the day.

870,markcincinnati,"October 16, 2015 7:32AM","Here's another issue that Cadillac faces:  The Auto Mall (AM).You can go to the AM and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the Cadillac dealer, the Lexus dealer, the Lincoln dealer and the Ford, KIA, Chrysler/Dodge, Hyundai and Honda dealers.  So, you test the Cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new Infiniti or Audi or BMW if you want.With the MSRP of the Cadillac so close to that of the Lexus or BMW, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given Saturday, Cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued.I just returned from a 4-day trade show in Las Vegas (at Caesars) and after the day's end I would walk down to the Forum Shops at Ceasars.  I found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.Seeing these watches, I thought about the Cadillac as I looked at the Tissot watch collection and then the Movado watch collection after having looked at the Rolex and MontBlanc watches.Tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- I'd take a Tissot over a Seiko any day.  But, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, Tissots just seem overpriced.  At that price I can move to Movado, but once I get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, I start to think, Tag, MontBlanc or even Breitling despite the price jump.  Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado.  The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.Cadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot.  For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately.  Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.Cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.I'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.The malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."
871,dino001,"October 16, 2015 8:45AM","Never been a big fan of Caddy's styling, but I always looked at a previous CTS Wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative.  Graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either.  I'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if I wanted something else.  E-class wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time.  Don'd care much for cladding on the Allroad.  I may check out V60, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""R"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - I may look at S60-R as a proxy).  All others dropped out."

I'd appreciate a URL if anyone here knows of one.I mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a GM car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80K on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" Pontiac Bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments.  He went ahead and got a new big-boy Dee-Lux CUV (Chevy) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.He also bought a super-nice Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square.  Perhaps Ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.Took my S4 in for the 35K service interval + a tire rotation last Thursday night; got an A7 with 5K miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (F/R heated seats, steering wheel) and LED headlights.  For all intents and purposes, the window sticker I found in the glove box bottom lined at $69K.  The option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly Nav and voice command and BT communications and WiFi hotspot were all included. It also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). Perhaps Premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which I thought odd, since there was an A6 Prestige on the showroom floor).The A7 was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point A to point B.  As Col Potter once said, ""there aren't enough O's in smooth to describe it."" Of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as I recall.The upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option.  But I hoped the A7 would be a true Luxury Performance Sedan -- especially for nearly $70K.In a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime.  However, I really could not find much of that German Taught feel I assumed would be present.  Oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.I had been, previously, loaned an A6 with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the A7.The thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10K more beautiful than a comparable A6 -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment.I was able to pull into the dealer in the A7 and five minutes later drive out in my S4 -- the main straight line difference was that the S4 is not quite as quiet as the A7, but everything else about the S4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior.Now, then, however, would I have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to Columbus, Louisville or Indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the A7 would be appreciated.I guess the S cars have the power to spoil (me at least). I simply would not pay the extra $13K for a relatively stripped A7 -- and if they were both $57K, the S4 would still be my first choice.  Makes me wonder how much better, even, the B9 S4 will be over the A7's.Drive it like you live.I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early).  I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change.  Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is.  If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound.  Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp.What did your 35K S4 service include?I told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not.  They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!).  Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use).  This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights),  I didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a resultAlso need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact.  Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning.  Need to follow up with them.  My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).CR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason.  Impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.I was charged 2.1 hours for 35K service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection.Charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads."

So either they were ripping people off (or letting their dealers do it!), and stopped when it was on their dime, or they significantly cut the confidence cushion!They have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year.  They lowered the mileage cap to 12k, I think.  Condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity.  The only thing it doesn't take into account is environment.

The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities.  My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil.  We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil.Maybe this is snake oil, so to speak.I have no insider info that says 5K changes are necessary.  Logic only leads me to the conclusion that 5K intervals cannot hurt and MAY help with engine lifespan.I really like my S4.  There is, at this point, no known US availability date for the B9 S4.  I figure I need to keep my current car probably another 2 years.  I have every incentive, therefore, to HOLD onto this S4 -- and god knows repairs to German cars are breathtakingly expensive.So, I figure it this way, ""what the heck, twice as many oil changes have no material downside.""If you follow the mfgr's representations pertaining to mntce, you are certainly OK within the OEM warranty period.Said it before: Drive it like YOU live."

Aside from the break in period and the variable valve timing actuator TSB the UOAs from my MS3 have been remarkably consistent- even when the car has seen the track.As for long-term reliability, the MS3 is currently at 156k and the X3 is knocking on 180k.Any issues with needed sludge and carbon deposits/build-up cleaned?

However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories.  So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity.  The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock.Upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like Rolls Royce).  They are walking the line between one type of customer, who wanta cartoday and another, who wantthe car, but can wait, if needed.Also, some people limit their choice to a color and perhaps couple of optional items (rest is not important), they focus on those plus price, others would rather walk on foot then get a car with a missing feature (or one feature too many)."

These ""S"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-S versions, so we thought 6% off of US MSRP was a decent deal -- and we both got EXACTLY the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.Now, having said this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay MORE for a new BMW purchased through the ED program than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the US for US delivery?Or does it mean negotiate your best price and THEN take 5% off for ED?My experience is that 5% is not all that hard to get from a US dealer, thus making the ED option less attractive with a reduction of 2%.Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower.This is not new, news, I think I mentioned this in one my report. 2% is roughly less then a grand, it's known that 10% off regualr MSRP is the norm for a good ED price."
935,robr2,"October 9, 2015 5:24AM","My understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car,  Rather, ED cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the US subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car.  Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."

This one was shorter, as more and more breaches came to light and market got sensitized to such news.It's almost never good time to buy right away after some truly company-specific adverse news with possible long-term consequences breaks out.  It takes the market some time to price all the risks, scope the damage, also there will be initially enough people who will try to play it as ""opportunity"" without fully understanding the scope. The experience is, when one big bad news comes, there will be a lot of follow up stories that will create more and more concern. It's only when the pessimism reaches certain levels, way out of proportion to the actual damage, then it's time to buy. Usually months, sometimes longer.  There is one important thing - the news must be really significant (potential 20 billion bucks levied by US government is important), legitimate (there are rumours, hoaxes, or embelishments happening all the time) and long-term (""more to follow"").The market is about pricing today future earning streams of companies and possible risks to them.  Most of the time, traders try to exaggerate every day news so they can make a bit of more money.  However, there are days, when it may be the opposite.  Sometimes, the right thing is simply stay away until the damage can be assessed and pessimism gets too high.  Not just yet for VW, IMHO."

Most buyers don't know that, though, since the EPA's name is on the official ratings.Instead, manufacturers ""self-certify"" and submit their data to the EPA. The agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.It's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by Hyundai and Kia, and then by Ford (twice), the EPA has said it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.But that's in the future. The VW trickery was discovered by a third party, which then passed it along a chain of contacts until it reached CARB and the EPA.(We've heard through the grapevine that ICCT shared its results with a Detroit Three automaker, which was actually the tipster to the EPA, but we've not been able to verify that--so treat it as rumor until proven otherwise.)"

The ""expert"" (I have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 PER CAR.  I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much.Anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so  many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't.  Therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance.  Why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?Another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which I assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no CURRENT way to meet these requirements.Sure, discoveries are made every day, and I think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.If I thought I could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would I risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers?Something doesn't add up -- I mean why would Cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge HP or MPG ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?I understand there are EPA haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, Martin Winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch TV where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or GM being called out for faulty ignition switches or Cadillac being fined for cooking EPA compliance records?Said it before, the only way to  keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead.  How many people at VW knew?  Did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of West Virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?As somewhat of a student of Adam Smith, I'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised (ill-advised, I'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.I just missed what the President of Nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear.""Wonder how  this will all play out?

The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year.  Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3.Presumably, the S4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the HP will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop.  Or perhaps the RS3 will be priced out of reach compared to the S4.  Now, then, this makes me wonder if Audi may think it needs a non-avant RS4 to go up against BMW and Mercedes high zoot models (now that the RS5 is gone).If history is repeated, the new S4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in MSRP, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.2017 (calendar) could be a very exciting year indeed.Mark...don't know if you saw the details...-Turbo 3.0 V6 (no more supercharger), 354 HP, 369 lb/ft, available from 1,300 RPM to 4,500 RPM.-6 speed manual (maybe), but most will get an 8 speed auto (no DSG) with a Torque Converter.-weighs in at 3594 lbs.-40:60 torque split front to back with standard Quattro-expected starting price of $50KI heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.If this is true, Audi should really just make the S4 with a CVT and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress.If the manual was made available, and my '14 S4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a DSG option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if I was getting another new S4.Otherwise, hello Golf R!"

I would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the DSG in normal traffic Enthusiasts will always lose out.With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven.  The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt.  I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions.  Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG  could be said to be somewhat like a CVT.  Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick.  Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness.  Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG.  Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please).  I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style.  But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7.  Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful""PHLTTTBBB""(aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man.  Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.What are the Audi DSG transmission issues?And, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?"

976,andres3,"September 17, 2015 11:05AM","breldsaid:As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good.  As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked.  Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual.  I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it.  That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model.  When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.In any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me.  I've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great.Congrats on joining the S4 owner ranks around here.  In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example).If the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny.  Heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress!  However, they made it even bigger, which makes me wonder if they could have shaved an additional 100 lbs keeping it the same size."

978,markcincinnati,"September 18, 2015 12:28PM","breldsaid:If I recall correctly from the articles on the A4, that actually will come with the DSG as the sole transmission.  With the upgraded 2.0T and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment.breld:One can only hope you are correct. The DSG, of course, that I would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed DSG such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current S4.  The press releases I have seen and have translated, however, claim the S4 will have the 8-speed Tip.  Current A4 2.0T models come with the 8-speed Tip, but NOT the DSG 7-speed.  Now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:The current iteration of the S3 ONLY comes with a DSG transmission -- a 6-speed version.  I assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but I have to assume the 7-speed DSG is heavier than the 6-speed DSG.  What I don't know is if the 8-speed Tip is lighter than the 7-speed DSG, however.I see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in Audi offering US customers the A4 with a 6-speed DSG since most of the A4's sold in the US the past few years have been 8-speed Tips.  I assume the number of takers on FWD A4's in the US is quite small, so for practical purposes, I will exclude them from my following remarks.Many of those in the market (for an Audi A4) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against BMW, Mercedes and perhaps even Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. In a world where ""more is better,"" I can only assume a new Audi A4 will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. BMW 3's will soldier on with 8-speed ZF sourced transmissions, Acura will have, what, a NINE speed transmission? Mercedes 7-speed, Infiniti 7-speed, who knows if Lexus will, for the 2017 MY offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the AWD versions and 8-speeds on the RWD cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?The new shopper will HAVE to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, Audi chose to offer 6-speeds (DSG or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, I would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""MORE is BETTER, so Audi is now not at the top of my list.""I have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the DSG 7-speed will no longer be offered on the B9 Audis.The only good news is that the 8-speed Tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the DSG via a very expertly developed shift program. Said it before, I'm at least OK with the 8-speed Tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic I've yet driven.""Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?"" - J.

979,markcincinnati,"September 18, 2015 2:18PM","My 2₵: The Value of AllureOur “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars;e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage VW beetle (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized).  This four-door “babe repellent” also had an AM radio, but it was also equipped with factory A/C – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.I loved these cars – I knew they were pieces-of-crap, but I blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me freedom, tunes (on the AM) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of Dayton, Ohio, to the big city (Dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a city in my opinion). Truth of the matter is that I rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to Dayton, nor could I regularly afford the 50₵ worth of Clark’s premium gas (Clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing.Today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:“Well I left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks,Just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot.Damn this traffic jam, how I hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow.Damn this traffic jam, time I get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.”James TaylorWhen my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow I was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36HP VW Beetle was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, I was no longer driving a machine, I was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. Crank up the single-speaker AM radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster.Everything was possible.Now, I have to admit, as much as the VW Beetle was not exactly a babe magnet, well the Valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though I figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain I didn’t “grind a pound” every time I shifted to first-gear. Even so, the Valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, I must admit).Still, everything was possible (in cars).Sundays, dad always would say “Let’s go for a little ride”.  Off we’d go: Mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 Chrysler Newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear AM radio speakers.  This one had aftermarket A/C even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over Chrysler-Plymouth dealer.  Ah, a big V8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! Someday this will be mine I thought.This car would be a babe magnet, I was sure of it.Today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most Americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. In fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “We’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.Then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we werebaaaad dudes: ""Man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. Woo hoo, “We're back in the saddle again”.Today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. The fact that a KIA (fill in the blank) or Toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly GPS and probably AM, FM, and Satellite Radio, plus CD, Bluetooth and iPhone connectivity for the iPod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “SE” guise these appliances lack. I mean, really, my piece-of-crap VW Beetle had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined.Not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. The cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. In a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. The cars lack allure.  We’re over them.  If there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new Mazda or Chevy or Ford or Dodge (fill in the blank)?  Nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.Those of us on the entry level (or Premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – FN’s trip to Europe driving a new BMW (his BMW, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. We’re again on the precipice. Again?  Yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). Gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children.  The thrill (of the next time I get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. The romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new Chevy Caprice almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.Does it really take $50,000 to get allure?  And, if so, how did it come to this?  My father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that I can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. I contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car.  I also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point. [Frankly, KIA may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]Now where did I put the keys to that Valiant?"

There were dozens of Audi colors apparently able to be specified -- I would call them non-custom.I understand that Pearl Swirl Pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, I assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps Bentley does this, but I would not imagine Audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)We're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra.  The Audi Exclusive line (should one venture into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.It just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question.  Silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black Audi calls Panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. Pull the other one.I know, I know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and I do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want.  This is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say.Rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is.  But at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.Even the Ibis White (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.I had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my S4, but I would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet RED leather was $1,000 upcharge.  God help me if I wanted the leather in a non-standard color.I'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available.  But 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up?  Luckily I am fine with white.Now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is OK.I've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost THAT much extra to get one in silver?Roll up your arm and bend over!It's all marketing and revenue maximization. Show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. BMW has been doing this for decades, Audi (at least in the US) not as long but they are getting there more and more.It's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16Gb which is pretty minimal. Of course the upcharge to 32 or 64Mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. Instant profit!"

Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers.We took the BMW factory tour this time and watch 3 series sedans and wagons being built, was very interesting to watch."

996,flightnurse,"September 4, 2015 9:18AM","So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..So my impressions of Italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the German or Austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the Right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.So we are motoring down the A5 autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a VW passat wagon (they are big in Italy) and yes, it's a TDI.. The VW driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that I didn't move over, Once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time VW driver is inch's from my bumper) I nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. VW growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. Top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, VW own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the Italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. Again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, I take off, and the VW gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. Again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again VW driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, I get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this A5 has 3 lane's in each direction) and the VW pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, I nail it get in front, and pull away. Had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. VW owner catch's up and passes me.. He finally got what he wanted. It's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster..FranceWhat to say about France, if you think the Germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from France. The attitude is, we can do that because we are french... Merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't.We stopped in Monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the Casino, and got a photo of the car, TALK ABOUT CROWDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cars, WOW, the Cars, I got one photo of a Lambo, lots of make there too. The streets are narrow REALLY narrow.. Lots of construction going on and our GPS wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the Casino, but we got there.MarseillesWhat to say about Marseilles, I didn't know much about the city except it was a port city. It's a very old city, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the GPS worked great, some of the streets we went down, were REALLY narrow,dirty, and stinky. Insane is a word that Rick used a lot....My thoughts of Marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north Africa, lots of different cultures, Christians, Muslims and so on. Have seen some women in Burka's walking about here and all over Europe, the native people of Marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. It's a very diverse city, the food says it all, more on that later.So here are the photos from our trip to France..In Italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the US, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are SUPERCLEAN... The next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.So we stopped at a French version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. A far cry from what the ones in Italy looked like,So car's in Europe, we have seen some American cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh  at.Monaco is supper clean, VERY clean in fact. Monaco is not a country, it is part of France, but it is a Principality, their license plates say,  Principality of Monaco on them..So I know you are all waiting for that Lambo photo, so here it is..Traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the French being The French have a fix....Once again the GPS, she works well, she really does but at times I have to wonder, when we left Monaco, we put into the GPS the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... For about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads..  She tries..So I'll end this installment with a photo taken from our Balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old, it's a night photo.."

Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials.  You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that.  It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French.  They do, but they want to be asked.Similar thing goes in some post Soviet Union countries.  They all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating.

1024,markcincinnati,"August 30, 2015 1:42PM","In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car.  Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.This mid-80’s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase “Turn on telephone” I could “Call home,” “Call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial.  Hands free, eyes free.  It was 1985.My first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command.  This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.When I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking).  My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.My 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity.  Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.I finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case.  The phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.Every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.The technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.Here’s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated  communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision  without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I’ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.Before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.I get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner – before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner’s Bluetooth – if I’m distracted, this takes 30 seconds.  My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the Audi Advantage (and  the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).I thought, way back there 30 years ago, “I can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.”  Is this technology not “way cool”?  And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?I do want to  be able to call home or the office without touching the  phone,  without looking at the phone and  without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow  drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I  can think of to make a phone call.Of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves.  Mean time, I’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.""Don't it always seem to go . . . that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?""

Whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter.I'm sure the new A4 next year will offer some sort of increase in size - maybe that will be a sweetspot for you.

1066,markcincinnati,"August 14, 2015 11:07AM","breld: My S4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect.  Having said that, I am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency.I ordered mine with A/S tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130MPH.  Mine is a Premium+ model (DSG 7-speed transmission) with MMI/Navigation Plus, Audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), B&O sound system/speakers, Audi-care and Carbon Fiber interior trim.  It, with shipping, came to ~$57K; and I paid 94% of sticker (member of the Audi Club of NA, discount of 6%).At my own option, I have doubled the # of oil changes (I go in every 5,000 miles, meaning I pay for every-other oil change.)  I have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since I got it).  I swapped the OE tires for Conti's Extreme Contact DWS/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.I would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like Cadillac did to the CTS line).  I see no reason NOT to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)I have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57K, I would have had to take a lesser-contented BMW 335i x-drive.  We've had 3 BMW's and this Audi feels more powerful than any i6 BMW we've had, but since the Audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison.I wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound Sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""A4/S4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if I knew then what I know now, I would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an S4.My complaints -- ONE; the car came with WiFi based on T-Mobile 3G technology.  If I actually could find and keep a 3G signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2G), I would be fine with the WiFi performance.  Ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from T-Mobile to AT&T with some software coding and a new SIMM chip -- I am now, always in 3G.  I read somewhere that the 2016 A4/S4's will offer 4G LTE radios, solving the T-Mobile (in our geography) performance issues.Love the feature of being able to Google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.Love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed DSG and the tuneage from the B&O speakers.Regrets?  Wish I had gone the extra $1,000 for the Sport Differential (Audi's name for torque vectoring).After driving an S4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the S4 is, somehow, broke.  The 3.0T motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . .driveway.  Ruh Roh!Hope this helps.P.S. I am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; I am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets.  In other words, there will be a new, B9, A4/S4 model -- MY 2017.  The 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new.  Audi, I believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.Discounts will be there for 2016 A4/S4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 S4 for $48K just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

1072,markcincinnati,"August 14, 2015 6:08PM","I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen.  As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex.  Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms.Early Audis with the TorSen system were 50 50 torque split, Haldex systems were typically 90 10 (F R) splits.In the US, at least, almost all Audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been TorSen, culminating in the cars using TorSen having a REAR biased AWD design.  The sport differential (rear only) further enabled Audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like Audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle.TorSen AWD systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.Currently Audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past.As far as I know, TorSen AWD systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.In day to day use, I have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although I do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially FWD car that happens to be able to shift power aft (Acura and Volvo spring to mind).Even so, an Acura TLX with SH-AWD can do a pretty good imitation of an S4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the FWD biased systems often still feel more FWD than AWD to me.I certainly have nuttin' but respect for Subaru; however, I would suspect most folks shopping for a $60K S4 or BMW 340ix probably don't venture into a Subaru showroom -- but, as usual, I remain, ""often wrong, but never uncertain."""

My only reason for such a conclusion is that Subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to AWD and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the WRX, has been praised as the Japanese S4.The differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 WRX to a 2010 S4.New vs. Old:2015 Subaru WRX vs. 2010 Audi S4:The new WRX meets an older version of what it aspires to be.http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/new-vs-old-2015-subaru-wrx-vs-2010-audi-s4-comparison-testNow for the fine print: Today, as a practical matter, several [many?] companies manufacture and market great AWD cars. It is also true that Audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long.Yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', Volvo's or Subaru's approach to AWD; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise Audi's approach as very significant and often superior.  Of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one AWD choice differs, is better or worse, than another.Often wrong, but never uncertain, I say: ""Nobody does AWD better than Audi."""
1075,dino001,"August 15, 2015 9:01AM","Mark, if anything, the link proves that Subaru could be argued as a winner.  It holds its own against motor with extra  65 hp and two cylinders.  It cost 20 grand  less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category).  Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority.  And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so.  Extra stuff, better AWD.  I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better.  Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value.  Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0,  see who wins.  And  WRX still costs less.  Even STI may cost less than A4/A5.It's easy to deliver a monster nobody can afford. Got extra 20 grand, get S4, got extra 40 grand, get RS4, when available, wanna keep the money, get Subaru."

1079,markcincinnati,"August 15, 2015 8:51PM","At this point, as I said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most AWD systems, regardless of MSRP.  I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit).Today, Subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the Premium Class.  For all I know they do have Audi AWD chops and are $20K or $40K less.  Even the C&D comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 S4 over a new WRX.  I read their words, I do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.I would, initially, expect a $60K car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40K car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise.  This would not  be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.For the moeny, were I to be given a Subaru budget, I would NOT opt for the 5-year old Audi -- I would indeed go with something NEW (very possibly the Subaru).My experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted S4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an Acura TLX SH-AWD (Advance). If the Premium Car experience was unimportant to this someone, I would certainly suggest they shop Subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having AWD.I have, very recently, read some reviews of the Nissan Maxima Platinum version -- while not a member of the Premium Class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new Maxima certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ELLPS -- although Infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.Most of what I seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise Audi's TorSen based quattro system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best AWD systems currently on the market.That Subaru's system may be right up there is something I shall surely remember when I come across such commentary or test reports. Mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, HERE of either Lambo's or Subbie's  systems, I suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: AWD vs 2WD -- my position is that AWD is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on.  I would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is / are four driven wheels."

1086,markcincinnati,"August 12, 2015 5:51AM","It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive.  Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices.  Or did the competition creep their prices upward?Eventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.Lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less.  Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.Two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.Cadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits.  In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk.  But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.You can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though.The investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.Oddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup.  The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.So Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.Of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing.  The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.We'll see."

They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady.  At least for now.  The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep.  The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big.  There is a history showing such big moves never work.  You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years.  Lexus knew it and where are they now.  Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models.  They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
1090,markcincinnati,"August 12, 2015 8:21AM","Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab.I have no wish for Cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of Sony's playbook.  I observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current CTS.For the most part, I would say I favor the Lexus LS400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to Mercedes is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers NOT to shop it.In some respects, it appears KIA has set its sights on the Premium (including entry-level premium) Class and is using the land grab approach.  It's sibling company coming out with the Equus, too, seems like a similar approach.  Don't know how it's going with the Equus as it, unlike Lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body.  That worked out well for the Phaeton in the US, eh?My board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth.  We changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled.  Of course my business is B2B, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so I assume there is some carry over.If you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time.  If you want to build gross margin -- PER TRANSACTION -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).The economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're Lambo or Porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in Cadillac's place, re-build a brand.I think, in part, BMW has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. Everywhere you turn (we have two BMW dealers in Cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new BMW owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new 3-series; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the BMW Store or Sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success.A few years ago, I read an article that said ""Everyone wants to be BMW;"" last year, if you can believe Car & Driver, et al, the headline was ""Everyone wants to be Audi.""  Of course the ""Everyone"" was speaking of Audi or BMW's rivals du jour.Hopefully Cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the cars be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""Tick-tock."

1092,markcincinnati,"August 12, 2015 9:28AM","Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5.  The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan.  Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan.Of course my Audi rep thinks the Macan costs $10-$15K more than an SQ5, and has made a Sticker Comparison to demonstrate that.Frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the Audi interior is second to the Macan's and the Macan has noticeably lower ground clearance.  From a power perspective, the Audi has both more HP and torque, but the Porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower RPM.The SQ5, were it to offer the German Market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the US), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the Porsche medallion?  The Porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the SQ5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel.Lots of options available on the Macan -- and those options can crank a Macan over $100,000. Our lowly SQ5 Prestige with a couple of options and in Panther Black with red leather seats came in at $65,000.Despite the similarities, there are obvious Porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the Macan with Porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the SQ5 a Porsche.You may cross shop them and I'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' Porsche.Drive it like you live.NB:  My wife decided the SQ5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the Macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. The Audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 Supercharged 354HP 346 ft/lb Torque ""CUV Hot-rod!"""

But, $5K worth should be relatively noticeable.If financed, might be a tough trade.  Bought straight out?  Take your lumps and move on.Had the car for 6 months -- has 103K miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? What was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market?  If so, how much below retail market)?  Let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2K below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3K in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.Are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? The last time I had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.Is this car this person's first BMW or first high-mileage European car?  My neighbor with 80,000 miles on a Pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. Most folks, these days are WARY of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain.And: How many times have we here said European cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty?  Answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. Of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. Really, we'll let that pass.Key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5K worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps?Whenever anyone I know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, I typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. Here in RiverCity, there are several BMW or German or European repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.I always seem to get someone here upset at me when I suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.What would a 2007 335i go for?  Locally a new 3-series can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. Often Accords can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.And (if it is a BMW) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles.  It seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with BMW's that's a hard argument to win.Going to an Accord, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the Accord in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.Some of us are ""types.""  After dozes of German cars, my wife and I each went with Infiniti [her] and Acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. My cousin, ""Mr. Honda or Mr. Mazda and now Mr. KIA,"" tried out a German and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local BMW dealership.Maybe it is telling -- I am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the BMW's ouster will be followed not by another German or European or even Premium car, but by a Honda Accord.  Again, there is nothing wrong with Accord's, but I would typically think folks who like BMW's unlikely to shop Honda's.  Were I in the same situation, I would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- BMW."

Lessons there for other companies outside the auto industry.  I tend to read his columns and listen to his interviews.He's an ego maniac, without a doubt. And, sometimes I scratch my head at some of what he says.  But, I think he's 83 now.  And, as such, most people I know that are entering or are in that age range pretty much don't care what others think.  So, they say whatever pops in their head.I'll forgive some of that based on giving due respect.  Overall, he's a pretty bright guy.He sort of painted his time at GM as him against the big car establishment.  Not sure how much is true and how much is bluster.  But, he got the company to take chances (i.e. ""new"" GTO, Solstice and Sky....too bad they were products of failed divisions).  He derided the Aztec.  He tried to move GM.  Wasn't entirely successful, but is willing to admit he wasn't, too.Colleague bought a new IS 350 F Sport.  I've always liked those.  I test drove one a year or so ago.  If anything, I like them more after seeing his (darkish grey with red leather interior).  Hard to fault the build of it....probably the best I've seen.  Still, a little cramped.  Maybe that's because I've been used to driving cars a bit bigger than the IS.  Seats are wonderful.  Just a very, very nice car that goes well, drives well, and is built extremely well.  His MSRP sticker said $49K....quite loaded up.  He said they discounted his by about $2,500.  Pretty good value for $46.5K. Hard to say that about a Lexus.GC, Lutz was also Rogers Smiths Yes man, and we all know what Roger Smith did GM...The IS cars are smaller then their competitor which is a negative for me.When it comes to Business read, my top read is NUTZ, by Herb Keller."
1102,tlong,"August 8, 2015 12:32AM","Cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace.Smart phones are like 8 years old (if we count the iPhone as the first ""modern"" smartphone; a bit longer if you count earlier ""windows mobile"" phones). So of course the pace of evolution is much faster.Auto volumes are also a lot lower. So it's too expensive to retool every year - unless you want to pay triple the cost. And a car represents a much higher fraction of the average owner's income, so it is not going to be replaced at the same pace as your phone.Regarding software and automakers, this is a very new area for them. They are not that experienced in software at the consumer level.

And it adds a lot of logistical complexity, too. Your headlight goes out - do you want one non-LED replacement, or two of the new LED equivalents? Let's stock duplicate sets of parts for all the different vintages and variants and versions of parts that are usable in the same basic model of car...etc. And the engineers retrofitting the LED lights to the existing Audi vehicles, the new LTE module to the existing vehicles, the new CPU to the existing vehicles - well they won't be working on designing the next model coming out in a few years then... unless you hire excess engineers for that...The Apple watch (and Android Wear as well) are designed to be mostly peripheral devices to your phones.

A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida.  Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz.  I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400.  No, thank you.  Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one).Sure, C-class looks better inside, but almost nobody buys 3-series for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure).   C-class is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ELLPS - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot.It's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. If you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what BMW does (and admittedly BMW charges double or triple of what Acura does). In other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars.  I wonder how much dealers sell it for as a spare partMB sometimes gives to dealers very substantial cash incentives once the novelty wears off and they are pretty good in hiding them from the public, so the brand stays protected, but even with that I'm not interested."

To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often.  The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.I was quite surprised to see the average age of BMW buyers was ""THAT OLD!""  But, you see, I've been going to the BMW Store here in Cincinnati at least since the mid 1980's, and my impression is that the show room is full of shoppers who are ""really really young"" -- and I have always presumed well-to-do.  I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW's because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin' friends).But back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60.

I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"".  GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right.  They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s.  Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union.  But that would have been uncomfortable.  Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while.  Who wants that, if you can pretend that nothing is wrong, do couple of faces to the cameras, like you are fighting those unions, then sign whatever they bring you and collect the bonus for a ""great job"".As far as I'm concerned, Lutz has zero credibility, even if what he says may be correct."

Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand.  But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity?  Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period.  Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more.  For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles.  In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease.  But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW....""The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease.  Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."
1131,andres3,"August 4, 2015 1:21PM","dino001said:markcincinnatisaid:The ATS sales are particularly disappointing.Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes.  ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy.  For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"", but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy.  Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before.  One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible.  How difficult is that?  Extremely.  Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts namethey will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club).  The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible.  Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can.  The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception.  By the time around 50s -60s  it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer.  It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership.  It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment.  Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product.  Cadillac is simply too big for that.  They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been.I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around.  They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers.  They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact.

One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.De Nysschen, Cadillac’s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.“The business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,” de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. “The luxury business is different.”He said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.”It’s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.A Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that’s not tied to sales performance.“There’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. “I did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”(more at the link)"

Fair enough. My gut feeling is that former M5 owners might love this CTS-V if they gave it a true test, but I understand that what drives one person to purchase a six-figure (or nearly) German performance sedan might not be sated with a domestic badge. But the Cadillac certainly makes a strong case for itself when spec sheets are measured.Take the previously cited competitive set from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes for example: The CTS-V has a clear power advantage over all of them. The M5 gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the RS 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the E63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. The Cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive Mercedes is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. But you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the E-Class is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base. Meanwhile, the Bimmer is roughly ten grand more dear, and the slant-back Audi about twenty-five.

Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand.  But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity?  Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period.  Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more.  For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles.  In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease.

1172,dino001,"August 4, 2015 7:12AM","markcincinnatisaid:The ATS sales are particularly disappointing.Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes.  ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy.  For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"", but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy.  Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before.  One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible.  How difficult is that?  Extremely.  Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club).  The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible.  Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can.  The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception.  By the time around 50s -60s  it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer.  It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership.  It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment.  Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product.  Cadillac is simply too big for that.  They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been."

1179,dino001,"July 18, 2015 11:06AM","This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars.  I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position.  European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions.  Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels.  Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process.  Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines.  This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc.  Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug)  lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK.  This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics.The regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process.  The situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. Thankfully, United States government never bought into that diesel BS to the same degree.  I also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. Navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), I suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing.I always maintained that Europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup.  Also, American ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe.  There is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on SUV-level. I think diesel Suburban, F-150, or even BMW X5 (or Honda Odyssey, if they made it) make perfect sense.  If you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, My problem was with worshiping TDI Jettas and Passats.

My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great,  but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment.  Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story.  The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal.  Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop.  It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."

I thought, here in the US, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.The message that I have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) In short, I have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods.""  The SQ5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in Germany, for instance.When my S4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400.  I assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if I had the diesel set up that is in the German market SQ5 in my S4.  Based on the AudiUSA website (which, for example offers up a 3.0T A6 and a diesel A6) I assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an S4d (if one were to be made for the US market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.That ""perception"" which I somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth.  Please elaborate -- here's why:  I have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, I assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.I read your post, however, and I wonder if I just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.Again, please elaborate on your point about Europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost universally, gasoline.Thanks."

No way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.Then, I test drove the 2014 S4 with a manual and the 7-speed DSG (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- I found the DSG to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical S4's) I decided the DSG actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother.  Moreover, I use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and I smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so I talked myself into the DSG.Now at some 30,000+ miles later, I find the DSG to be the best transmission experience I have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, I used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.I am fortunate to also have another Audi an SQ5 with an 8-speed Tiptronic.  Oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an S4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the SQ5 manual vs Tip since Audi only offers the SQ5 with the 8-speed.) But the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the Coke Zero of Cola -- it's not Diet Coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.The march forward of auto trans technology is, I would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings.  And, even though the DSG easily justifies its existence, I wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the SQ5.  I would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the paucity of stick shifts -- the only one I can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual dexterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.I'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.But, I would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.Thanks."

Which is why Mazda is appealing if you are trying to be economical but still get some involvement.I was initially looking at a GTI back in 2007, but the local VW dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&Tandwas reasonably quick so I figured, why not?Funny thing: at my first BMW CCA HPDE with the Mazdaspeed(dead stock, OEM tires) it was raining a bit during the first instructor session. I lapped every car on the track.Twice."

While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects.I vascilate on the IS 350 F Sport.  On the one hand, it's a fun drive.  Not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering.  Love the seats, too.On the other hand, it's cramped.  Certain features are just confounding.  Overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse.  That puts it in the price ballpark of the TLX SH AWD ADVANCE.  That's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.That C CLass and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).Now, all of a sudden, I ask myself ""is a 335i worth $10K more?""  No immediate answer comes to mind because I'd have to ponder that one long and hard.No disrrespect meant for those who like the Q50.

1212,markcincinnati,"June 30, 2015 1:35PM","New ShoesThe '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires.  The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round.  My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles.  This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" ratedGrand Touringtires, albeit from Continental.  The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.Meantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06.  Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can't believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)Here's the [current] bottom line:These tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology.SPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.I'd say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I'm used to in my neck of the woods.A set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").I had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.I plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.Now I do oh-so-sincerely wish I had remembered to order the Sport Differential.DOH!"

1217,markcincinnati,"July 2, 2015 1:20PM","Product Life Cycles: It's Time for a ChangeThe Germans -- and for all I know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years.  My 2014 S4 is so very similar to my 2009 A4 (that I bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.Here is what this means: an A4 (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the US) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016.Now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 S4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 A4.  But progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.It's no wonder the A4's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off).  The phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released.Now, I'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, I'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.Yet Audi, BMW and Mercedes seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline.  There is some historical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.Now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.Conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems.  Increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. Furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.I recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from Windows 7 to Windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the OS on my Apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from VHS to DVD to BluRay without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.Airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as I said, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to FAA requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.I understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but I believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. Folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption.Imagine if the new iPhone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for UHD-TV because HD hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.Audi, BMW, Mercedes and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the Law, Moore's Law, that is."

1219,markcincinnati,"July 3, 2015 7:12AM","Jurassic Audi?I am happy that Audi brought the A3 to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold.  Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3's are on the showroom floor.  I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5's (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however.  The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3's just like the high zoot Q3's have no problem being a member of the family, however.I have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges.  For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one.  Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.But, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name.The current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3'ssturm und drang.The S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo.  When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)So, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seemsalmostmore like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.My remarks, it should be emphasized,  pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions.  An upscale Premium+  or Prestige model A3 certainly seems to fit right into the family dynamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.The S3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the Jurassic World Audi, perhaps."
1220,markcincinnati,"July 8, 2015 10:44AM","How's Them NewTaars?""Taars"" mid-west col·lo·qui·al for ""Tires""Hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since I have no financial interest whatsoever in Continental Tires or The Tire Rack or The Audi Connection, despite spending money with all three entities.The new shoes -- Continental DWS 06's -- have been on my '14 S4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 SQ5 (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, July 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain.  The puddles have puddles, in fact.This is really the first day I have driven with the DWS 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.Up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences.  And, to put a finer point on things, the report I would give would have been easily rendered: Excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and comfortable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")I was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to.  Of course, it rains -- which, in Cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights.""  You see, Cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- EVERY SINGLE TIME it rains, sleets or snows.  This leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. Such is life.With some trepidation, therefore, I decided, initially, that ""ACD"" (assured clear distance) calculations had to be modified to make certain I could stop rather than ram into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.No worries.The ""W"" in DWS (Dry Wet Snow) came through like a champ.  The car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as I could tell behind the wheel.  I half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and I'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""I swear"" position -- I didn't detect any even on that one curve I forgot about as I winded my way toward I-71S.Another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her SQ5 with the same new shoes as mine; she and I were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances.  And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires.  For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.Two comments on that:#1 My fault, my bad, for not fitting DWS's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)#2 Audi's fault, Audi's bad, for selling an ""S"" car with all-season Grand Touring H-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?""Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round.  When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""H"" rated family sedan fitments.  Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires.I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).Livin'Drivin' the dream.Mark"

Only for a different reason, I keep crossing off cars off my list that might be interesting, but could be potentially a hassle to own.  My CTS comes immediately to mind.  Good looking.  Has all the ""right stuff"".  But, just a nightmare to own.One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside.Regarding the Mazda, we do have an '07 Mazda 5 and I find the 4 cyl quite refined for a 4. Of course it is not a hot rod but it has a tighter turning circle, better steering feel, and is way more agile than my TL, which is probably why I would consider the Mazda 3. A fully loaded 3 is almost like a baby Bimmer and fully loaded seems to be just as nice from an interior POV, an area where to me the 3-series has always fallen a bit short."

Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife.  It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather.Regarding another post about Mazda's and Audi's, I too, find the new A3 interior to be a bit of a let down, but only as compared to what is expected of Audi interiors.  I think the '06+ A3 interior was superior.  Of course, a GTI today can cost more than my A3 did in 2006, so inflation is a factor.  I would say the A3 still has a better interior than any Mazda, but of course you pay for it.  Nothing against Mazda, and not trying to bash them, but this is my impression from the last Mazda 3 rental I had a few years back:1) All-around good economy car.2) Coming from then being a current A3 owner, it felt like it had really thin sheet metal.  Experience felt like I was driving a tin can car down the road as compared to the A3 being a bank vault or tank.  Tin can is a bit harsh, probably more appropriate to use that term on the late 90's Kia Sephia rental I had.   But there is a noticeable difference."

I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis.I think I favor a bit more of the luxury side compared to some of those on this board since obviously if I wanted pure speed/handling I could go BMW. To get decent luxury in a BMW you pretty much need to add $10K for all the options and even then IMHO the Audis are nicer. But the prices on the Audis have gone somewhat stratospheric since I bought my '98 A4 brand new. At that time the Audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end 3-series that was a lot more stripped. Nowadays Audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late '90s."

I was surprised to feel that the TLX is really not so different in size or style than my '05 TL - a full 10 years older! The shapes are familiar, the interior still looks familiar, with the expected tarting up of LEDs, different fascias, bumpers, etc. My TL is like 250hp v6 and why would I buy a 4 cyl TLX for the same price or more than I paid for my TL? Too similar for my tastes and although the TL has been a great car, I guess I need a change and the TLX isn't it. I also find the TL/TLX just a bit bigger than I like and I want something a bit smaller and more agile. My TL is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our Mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. I'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. Power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important.I agree with your assessment.  In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX.   Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced.10 years ago I was able to get a sport packaged equipped Audi A3 for about $30K out the door, nowadays, that wouldn't get me a loaded GTI.Seems to me you might want to try the Golf R, reviews seem to say it is nice, refined, and should give that tight agile feel your looking for at under $40K, if you can find one.  I didn't like the A3 for it's too small trunk, too plain interior, but I did like how light and toss-able the chassis felt."

On top of that, I change out of cars often enough that I'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as I am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""freedom"" to try different cars out.When I say I am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the BMW and the Mazda3 - perhaps that was misleading.  For what type of car I was looking for, the Mazda really fit the bill well.I was sort of in a large sedan mode with the 535i (xdrive), having also just come out of a Passat.  But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver.  I also was interested in a manual transmission.  Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda.  And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route).  The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.I most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well.  Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series.  I've also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10).  The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into.  I just didn't realize how much I'd be longing for the increased driver involvement.So, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3.  Within a year or two, I suspect I'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a 4-series GC once they start hitting the used market."

1260,markcincinnati,"June 12, 2015 8:35AM","I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase.  We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too.The little engine that could (the 2.0T) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and I believe will be again goosed to 240.  Under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 RPMs.And, without breaking a sweat, apparently, Audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300HP for the S3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0T (at 200HP and 207lb/ft) in the Q3 (this, I am assured, is temporary, the Q3 will soon come with the beefier 2.0T).My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque.  Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines).  The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. . . .I would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of HP and Torque.Now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel SQ5 were to be offered (in the US) even though it's HP would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""S"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.Probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine Audi of America would actually bring the SQ5 in diesel trim to the US.Look for all of the Europeans, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and VW to name just a few, to continue the march upward in HP and Torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of V8s, V10s, V12s and W12s.I have not heard anything about decreasing the power,Of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines Audi (among others) offers in markets other than the US.  There are smaller (than 2.0T) engines offered by Audi in some of its cars in Europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.My answer assumes you were talking about US bound Audi engine offerings."

As for Kelly, he has the north shore Fiat and Herb has the north shore Chrysler/Dodge/Ram.  Herb got Fiat in metro west/Worcester because he has the Chrysler/Dodge/Ram there and thus he got Alfa.IMHO, many automakers are leery of Chambers as they feel he has too much power in such a small area.  MB brought in a dealer group from Cleveland for the new MB location in my town - about 1/2 mile from the Chambers Audi/Porsche location.  Chambers through his attorney has accused the planning board of impropriety in their approval of the MB store and has stated that the planning board is being too hard on Chambers' parking lot expansion at the Audi/Porsche store.  The planning board is simply trying to ensure safety at that location.  IIRC, that location did not finish the original project as approved.

1300,dino001,"May 29, 2015 9:33AM","Sport suspension IS NOT standard, read again.  328/335 has standard current Sport Line aesthetic elements and seats.  You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package.  However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering.  If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form.They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess.  Can get this, but not that, etc.  It's simplified and more available, BUT now you will be able get black with red stitching (which I love) only with regular suspension.  ""Sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the Sport Line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those M-sport packages.  This is nuts.They increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year.  Actually, it's much better.  However, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't.  Premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for LED lights.  340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue.  Leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option.  I predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year.  Now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option.  Once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers.  BMW went essentially Mercedes way.  I hate that.So if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference).  However, for 328 I see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more.  Good example is that leather vs. LED in premium package.  The former has stable pricing in terms of supply, but they will be paying less and less for the LEDs (rapid development of new products pushes supply prices down in that segment), but keeping the profit for themselves.The whole red stitching thing vs. sport suspension is just my personal disappointment, but not end of the world."

But. I'd never heard of Moreno until he moved into the Cincinnati area.  He's done well in the short time he's been down this way.My guess is he's put a significant dent in the Cincinnati new Mercedes market by takig away business from the established player in Montgomery and West Chester.Moreno was an intern at Automobile magazine and then worked for Saturn.  Chambers hired in as the manager of his Saturn store and Moreno moved up to VP supervising 9 Chambers' locations.  In 2005, MB offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in Cleveland.  Since then he has opened up 30 stores - MB, Porsche, Acura, Lotus, Aston, Infiniti.MB only opens a store if they see potential for increased business.  They wouldn't saddle a business with a $20 million building if it was a zero sum game.  I'm guessing there was a demand for that open point as south of Cincinnati since the next closest store is in Lexington.  His store here in my town was considered an open point.

I would have had to shell out $1400 for a RT coach ticket, but for 50K miles point and a whopping $10.80 tax, was able to snag RT FC tickets.. So I have some free days at National, so when I arrived at Newark Airport at 11:15pm (thank you mother nature for our 2 hours delay) the pickings where mighty slime, The first car I went for was a new Camaro, but when I walked up to the car, someone was sitting it, damn... Then I saw the Arrest me red 2015 Dodge Challenger, first time driving the LH cars with the new 8 spd transmission and updated interior.  WOW.. What a fun car, even though it rained the entire time I was in Jersey the car was still fun. Nice thick leather steering wheel, If I was blind folded and felt the wheel, I would have sworn it was the M Sport Wheel from BMW, that is how nice it was. The transmission had a sport mode, which only seemed to change the shift pattern of the transmission to be more aggressive, the seats were very nice, comfortable and supportive. Fit and Finish was first rate, the dash, door panels felt nice..Even though the LH cars are big, they drive great, I was very surprised on how well they drive...  Glad to be home, 3 days of rain was getting to me.."

However, some people in their forum can't wrap their head around this concept, just like on bimmerfest, some guy was very insulting to people who have a 528i and 535i, because in his small mind the only 5 series worth having is the 550i."

1330,nyccarguy,"May 19, 2015 11:54AM","markcincinnatisaid:Experience with this?I'm closing in on new tires for my 2014 S4 (18"" wheels).  I live where we have moderate winters -- typically very few snow days, and when we do, they last a day. I have no interest in taking my car to any track event.  I am also, typically, not interested in swapping from summer only to winter tires and back.

We all think we're great drivers, no doubt.  I drive on the Interstate Highway system here in SW OH, which is to say it is full of pot-holes and every spring the new pot hole crop becomes evident.  It is like driving a freakin' obstacle course.  Having said that, I do drive once weekly between Cincinnati and Columbus (200 miles round trip). Much of the trip the ambient speed is 80+, some of the trip is 90+.

I have H rated ""Grand Touring"" tires on the car -- OEM's.  They have been OK.  

My thought is to replace these tires with the Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06's.  My wife's 2014 SQ5 has the ""last gen"" DWS's -- and they have been very good.  

I'm thinking there is some evidence that the DWS 06's are an improved in every way version of the DWS's.  There is little info I can find about the tires, although TireRack does seem generally to approve of them.

These tires are UHP's and will be W rated.  Their lifespan should be quite good, if the DWS (prev model) is any indication.

Are the tires quiet?  Do they improve turn in? Are they rounder than most?  Etc?

If you have any personal experience with these on your ELLPS or LPS cars, I would be interested in your comments.

I don't know what being leased or not has to do with replacing tires -- when the OEM's go, well, you replace them (unless you are within a very short period of end of lease).My 2009 had Dunlop MAX Performance 19"" 35 series tires on it.  They had become substantially ""not fun"" any more at 11,000 miles -- and were said (to me) -- to be pretty much useless by 15,000.  I had a blowout (when the outside temp was single digit above 0F) and the tread was so far gone I went ahead and bought 4 instead of the two I would have purchased had they not been those summer only MAX Performance tires. I had a 36 month lease on that one and, well, I was into the lease perhaps 9 months at that point.When you gotta go, you gotta go.I am considering keeping this S4 out of lease -- considering.  In any case, for the next couple of years, I want the best -- most fun -- rubber I can have on the thing, all things considered.UHP all-seasons seem to be a reasonable compromise -- I'm just hoping someone here has DWS 06's and cares to comment.Thanks!"

1340,andres3,"May 24, 2015 3:23PM","flightnursesaid:andres3said:Andres you keep beating a dead horse i.e GM and the Old Days, just like what you are doing with Chrysler.The reason why GM was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, Caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive Caddy that didn't drive well. That is why GM imported a Opal that could zig. Buick was dying for the same reason Caddy was, in the past 5 yrs both brands are enjoying a come back and I hope they continue, it only makes the competition better.Chrysler (really Dodge) is doing the same thing, when MB bought them people were waiting for good things to come from that marriage, and it finally did the 300, but that was too late for MB, MB wanted Jeep and didn't care about everything else. Out of the that marriage MoPar got the independent suspension from the E class and their 5 spd transmission which made the 300 the success it was/is. Sure the Crossfire was an american version of the SLK.I'm not too sure why you have to harp on GG, he has every right not to like Audi right now, allow him to do that. You love your S4, great, keep doing so. I'm glad we have a couple of Caddy owners here, I like to hear how they are holding up..I agree that more competition is better for the market overall.  However, I feel like sustaining failed business models like GM and Chrysler stifles competition from other would be startups and potential new car companies that would have provided different (and probably better) competition.  Sure they've changed, but I don't' think enough.I'm not harping on GG.  I don't blame him for not liking Audi.  Bad Customer service should result in lost customers.  I like hearing from Caddy owners as well; the more information I have the better I say.I just empathize with him because he's going through something I've sworn to avoid in my lifetime.  One of the reasons I won't give Chrysler a 2nd chance is because I don't want to be in the weak position of having to fight them from being burned twice.  I wouldn't have any patience for failures; however minor; so it's best I avoid them since I'd be a picky nitpicky customer for sure.

They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board.  There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it.  I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option.I like the changes.  I have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content.  This is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model.  I'm sure 4-series GC will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later.  It will be between 440 GC and 328 wagon (I'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming).

I can offer you a few pieces of advice.  1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership.  Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015).  Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate.The Legacy will definitely be roomier inside.  The interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere.  The legacy will ride smoother.  I got my Legacy before the Eyesight was available.  I originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but I couldn't wait.

So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..The 340i gets the new ""B"" series engine, so hopefully there will be a MPPK for this engine and Exhaust which would give the car roughly 370hp.Regarding living in large cities, I have cousins who live in the Upper East Side (of Manhattan) they have a 2001 BMW 330i, that has 54K miles on it. Like you said GG, their world is about 8 blks from their apt, and the subway line in half a blk away, no need to really drive. They had their car from when they lived on Long Island,  they have been in Manhattan now 8 yrs, and have put on about 12K miles on those 8 years.In regards to Jag, I hope the XE is a success for them, this will only make the competitors even better.Don't people in NY ever go on road trips????

1378,andres3,"May 3, 2015 7:16PM","markcincinnatisaid:henrynsaid:I, for one, would still do it.  Delete the sunroof, that is, even if the price did not decline.Sunroofs steal headroom, usually about 2 inches.  The only car I have been in with a sunroof that did clear my head was a Genesis.According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles.  The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc.  We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is:  test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount.  A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday.  Wham bam, thank you m'am.Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride.  But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling.  I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?Clearly, there is something wrong with me.I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them.  I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking.  See, something's just not right with me.The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars.  Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich.  Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted.  Is this still European practice?Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all.The 2014 S4 Order form I used to customize my order for the 2014 S4 didn't have a ""delete Moon-roof"" option written on it.   I suppose I should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, I'd of probably hesitated to delete it.  If they'd even give me $50 back I'd do it."

Which I don't understand since the dealer wouldn't be paying interest on these cars and would be off the lot the following day it arrives...But they are paying interest on those cars sitting on the lot.  Cars cost the dealer money each day they sit in inventory.But it is argued they order the options and colors that ""sell fastest,"" so that argument holds no water.  Why are they paying money for inventory sitting if it ""sells fast.""I think this is the chicken and the egg scenario.  Dumb car sale managers are controlling what Americans buy because most don't want to wait 6 to 12 weeks for their car.   I know with Audi's, if you want what you want, you have to custom order; I'd estimate 90% of the time as dealer's don't like to trade Audi's."

1383,markcincinnati,"May 5, 2015 11:13AM","Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc)  is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6.  This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon.The issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""Long in the tooth.""  I have a 2014 A4 (B8) sub designated S4.  I had a 2009 A4 2.0T Prestige that I took delivery of in 2008.  A NEW 2015 A4/S4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available A4.  There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4's available yet.But, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY.  Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.At the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long.  No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.Now, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half.  I have 25K miles on it.  I love this car.  I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.I am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.I assume my current S4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof.  I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week.  I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.Subsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change.  Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.And, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order.  My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.I don't know anything about ""ordering"" Hondas, I would no more do that than I would order a new electric can opener, however. I'm partial to Oster's,  if you care."

But they are fine automobiles that must be doing something right as they sell hundreds of thousands every year.+1. Not everyone worships at the altar of German cars.  Some of us would rather drive Honda's and retire early than drive fancy-schmancy cars.  To each their own."
1385,markcincinnati,"May 5, 2015 7:43PM","I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.Honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for.  That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW's and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.To some extent, we all settle.My opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much.  I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD.  They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/  Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also  have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras.  The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.It takes all kinds.I would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012.  The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.I am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.Every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect.  We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher.  Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.The point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you.  If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here.  If you'd rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage.  I have no quarrel with that.If you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.Settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.This is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.That is why I say: Drive it like you live..So far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that I don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."
1386,graphicguy,"May 6, 2015 7:23AM","I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area.  As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.Knowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C.  But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.Anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what I'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger).  They were having some private showing of a GTS.  I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".Clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S.  But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it.  IF they let me drive it....even better.I'll cut to the chase.  They didn't let me drive it.  Got to sit in it, though.  I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have.   But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.Can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.As I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside.  Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not).  This wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl.  Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought.  Told him I liked the color combo better than any I'd seen so far.At the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour.  This one, was quite different.  Very pretty.  Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left.  ""Go for a spin?"".""I'm not in the market"".Sales-""I'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""""Fair enough"".It's taken me awhile, but I've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl.  Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me.  They're torquey.  More fuel efficient.  Lighter.  And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I've had recently.  Truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.This one is no different.  I don't know the specs, but it's typical.   No turbo lag that I could ascertain.  Quick off the line.  Pulled hard over a broad RPM range.  It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like).  7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this.  It's smoother than my CTS trans, but I've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans).C Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD.  The Benz felt tailored to me.  I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.My CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch.  CTS suspension is geared more towards handling.  C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own.  At least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.Now, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category.  Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they've built........EVER!C Class is over the top, especially at the price point.  Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier.  They felt the same, too.  Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself.  Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).I didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"".  Cadillac does a much better job.  I don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a Mercedes trade mark (really?).  My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.Final thoughts.  The C stickered for right around $50K.  Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range.  At that price?  A very compelling car.  The interior is what would sell it.  It's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc.  ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).Maintenance?  Included with Cadillac for 4 years.

Delete the sunroof, that is, even if the price did not decline.Sunroofs steal headroom, usually about 2 inches.  The only car I have been in with a sunroof that did clear my head was a Genesis.According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles.  The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc.  We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is:  test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount.  A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday.  Wham bam, thank you m'am.Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride.  But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling.  I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?Clearly, there is something wrong with me.I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them.  I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking.  See, something's just not right with me.The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars.  Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich.  Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted.  Is this still European practice?Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all."
1394,stickguy,"April 28, 2015 5:45AM","Most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too.  Like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small.Some people also buy because they need a car quickly.

It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic.  In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week  - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course.

Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy.  For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money).  I just don't bother test driving them, therefore.I have test driven an X6 -- and NOW, I know I wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible.  Also test drove an Acura ZDX, for the money, it was better than the X6, but, for the money, I'd go with an MDX and pocket the $10,000.  Likewise, I just CAN'T justify an Audi A7 or S7 when, since I have driven both, there is an A6 and S6 that are as far as I am concerned identical.  Now, I do like the looks of an A7, but not $10,000 more than I like an A6, and so on.I tested a couple of Jeeps (even the SRT 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the SQ5.I can't see myself testing a Malibu -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.Same with a KIA Soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but I would try (and have) an Optoma and am interested in a Genesis as a possible old-fart's alternative to an A6 for when I am 73, not 63, perhaps. And so forth.I don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).I'll not be testing a VW bug anytime soon, but I have tested the Toureg (and the Cayenne) and the Q7, too -- a VW CC sure is purty and in AWD trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.Within reason -- REASON -- I would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on.  My wife and I test drove an Acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 FX35 (Infiniti).If ""y'all"" want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum, I would think that, plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive.But, on the other hand, kids, in-laws, dogs and cats, broken pipes and blown A/C compressors can sometimes get in the way of the 'serious bidness' of test driving cars [for a living].Drive it like you live."

1409,dino001,"May 1, 2015 7:22AM","flightnursesaid:But we all know that American want that ""instant"" gratification, of walking into a dealer test drive, deal, and drive off with said car. Waiting 4-6 weeks is a life time to many Americans. I also do not think the dealers are willing to explain that the buyer can order a car of their choosing. Which I don't understand since the dealer wouldn't be paying interest on these cars and would be off the lot the following day it arrives...It's the same instant gratification.  The salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today.  The order is in the future.  It can be canceled.  The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops.  The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it.  The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions.  They essentially already decided for us what we want.The German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot).  Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer).  They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system).Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger.  Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered.  There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations.BTW, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory.  In aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost.  Also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it?  Because pricing decisions are only loosely linked to actual cost.  The other parts are demand, psychology, planning, volume incentives, etc."
1410,dino001,"May 1, 2015 7:54AM","LOL, Roadburner.  I think VW had one of the most inconsistent dealer networks out there.  From absolutely horrible to first class and all in between.  My observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation.  If it belongs to a same place where premium German cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant.  Cross-pollination with fellow BMW or Audi usually helps.  However, if it belongs to one of those Hyundai-Kia-Toyota-VW-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason.  Attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well.  However, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a Kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a VW store, he is not going to change his habits."

Norwood WAS the city that made Firebirds and Camaros.  WAS the city.

Time and time again GM would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, GM said, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant.  Millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end.  The response?  The workers ""threatened"" productivity.Too little, too late.I bought and/or leased ONLY stick shift cars through 2003.  I couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, I decided, ""I'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""YOU are the reason the cars are as they are -- I bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from Germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions.  Now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity?  Too little too late.Now, you're being told, I gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""M"" BMW -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100%  certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.The cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in BUYERS) of whatever it is they sell.If they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.You'd think this was some  sort of plot against you -- foisted upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce  more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!?

Some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift.  Clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rubber meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.Let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading.  The reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is MONEY.If you think we should have BMWs like they used to be decades ago, fine -- pony up the money.Not gonna happen, not gonna happen.I took a long test drive of an Audi S5 with the torque vectoring rear differential option and a DSG transmission -- Old School would be run over, chewed up and spit out by this . . .  nothing old school, affordable by mere mortals, even comes close to this kind of performance.It's all about the Benjamins."

Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor..

They just sub it out and mark up the price.Even getting OEM glass isn't that simple.  My understanding is that the OEM parts depots don't stock many windshields because of the time it takes to ship one via truck to the dealer.  The aftermarket glass industry does such a good job and does it immediately that it's almost pointless for dealers to try and replace windshields.I've had 3 windshields replaced, all by Safelite and IIRC, all the glass was Carlite who is a huge OEM and aftermarket auto glass company.Rick had his windshield replaced on his Geneses twice, the first one was so distorted that I was surprised that the installer from safelite even installed, that was replaced the same day, his second one was OEM  and didn't have a problem.

Which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. In my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and  my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves I can refer to the MS3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face.My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that.Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers.I've been looking around for a manual CTS-V and they are certainly thin on the ground- good ones are, at any rate.

So the crowd came, but BMW decided the services of shouting are no longer required.  They may be right, for now.  It's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, BMW goes Acura's way.   It's easy to imagine that.  Acura was also on the rise, until it was not.  They basically have two models of consequence - MDX and TLX, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old TL.  I don't know, we will see."

The word I honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled.It would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.Far as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.Current auto review magazine's still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese.  When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German's usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).Generally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.I so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350.  I was mistaken -- an S4 was ""within reach.""The point or better said, question, is, when were the Germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by Lexus and Infiniti, to quote laurasdada's previous post?Driving it like I live . . ."

To a large extent the 1st legend and Infiniti were it along with the 3 series.Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).So, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi.  Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in.The Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though).  Then, I don't recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets.  The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America).  Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.I would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.I assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.So, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.Mercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of Mercs.And, while I pretty much agree about BMW's -- a 1980's era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.The folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate BMW's and Porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works.I'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""Check out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares? Hmmm?)This needs to be updated (to include a Japanese stereotype and to relate it to cars):""Heaven is where the cooks are French, the police are British, the mechanics are German, the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss.Hell is where the cooks are British, the police are German, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.""Any takers?"

My last two cars have been Jags, likely fueled by memories of my Dad's friend's Jag E-Type convertible (and the fact that they are beautiful, fun and reliable cars!).  But, I grew up during the era of fuel economy, hot hatches and the rapid ascent of Japanese cars.  My father lusted after the BMW Bavaria, but friends that had them couldn't vouch for their reliability and he grew tired of the expensive repairs to the Mercedes and so they went Japanese (including a Datsun 260Z!).

But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades,  So, not sure I can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.So, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.All that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3.  Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4).  Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town.  He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car).  It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.Kind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager.  He said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group.  He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back.  Go figure.Anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's Porsche store next week.  He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn't denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car).  Last day at Audi is today. Starts at  Porsche on Monday.I told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff.  He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires.  He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.He did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior.  He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive.

My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained five other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary.  One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing.  It's hard to estimate how much it's worth, as they can also turn off part of the audience as well, some people may not want to associate themselves with what they may perceive as a juvenile snob subculture.  It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side of it and went on compromise.  We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years.BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out.  It was the 328 vs 2.0T.  Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests.Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why.My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word).  In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.I'm guessing that BMW's monthly check was bumped up a bit."

No issues at almost 4,000 miles.There is certainly much to like about the S3, for me.However, the price is quite high when well equipped,to me \ from my point of view.For example:Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point.  Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM.  It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb.  The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one.  Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality.  Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive.  With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well!I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch.  I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.Clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.That’s all I recall – last drove one in December.- RayQuite happy with my current choice . . ."

An ATS stays 138 days in dealer inventory.I read the same thing this weekend.  Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination.  Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again.  I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up.I wonder what kind of deals are out there.  Or perhaps, GM reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price.  This happens sometimes.  Midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing.  Also, GM used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales.  Old habits die hard?  I really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all.  Perhaps it all comes down to price.GM and Cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure.  They want to be considered equal to the Germans, so they list price their cars accordingly.  But because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation.  They could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. It's a tough business, for sure.   I think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those German guys.  For example, BMW has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. There are (or at least used to be, when I got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only).  I heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot.   I wonder if Cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever Detroit guys send them (I heard that was the case for lower-tier brands)."

This dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car.  Well, of course they don't have loaner SQ5's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an S4.  She said, ""Since my husband has an S4, could you put me in something that I don't normally have access to?""  Service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""Sure, what would you like?""  My wife says, ""How about an A7 or S7.""  ""Well the last A7 just left, but we have a 2015 3.0T A6 with sport package that you might find interesting . . . ""Longer story short: She takes the sported-up A6 and drives it to work, the grocery store and home.  Next morning (Saturday) she asks me to return the A6 and pick up the SQ5.The A6 is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet.  The thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no drama.  There's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- I got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.And, at $59K, it is about the same MSRP as my S4.  I could see myself driving this thing -- it has more comfort, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.Then I get into a stretch that I know from many years of experience is full of twisties and off-camber turns and those kind of ""liquid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate.  Kind of upside down speed bumps.In any case, I am seriously looking forward to the ride.That is, until I take my first corner at speed -- about triple what the posted ""curve ahead"" yellow sign with the big black arrow ""suggests.""  The car has NO issue taking the turn,  It seems unflapped by my request for it to turn in sharply -- it does not understeer (that I could tell, anyway) and the tires didn't howl.Damn, damn, damn -- the leather covered driver's seat is a flat as a board and about as slick as a kid's slide. The car takes the turn with great aplomb -- too bad it all but threw me overboard (thankfully I was wearing my lap/shoulder belt and was holding on to the steering wheel with both hands.)Somewhere I heard, or thought I heard, ""WHOA NELLIE!""My 2009 A4 Prestige with sport package and my 2005 A6 -- BOTH of THEM -- had sport seats (optional, yes). I returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so I asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""Can I order sport seats on a new A6 with the sport package?"" And,  ""Can I order sport seats through the Audi Exclusive channel?""The S6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the A6, no matter how optioned cannot.What a world, what a world.

Either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidentsIt's not as simple.  Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it.  The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere.  Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract?  I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract.  So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance.  Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too.  It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent.I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4.I'd leave instructions for my heirs to sue for everything Hertz and the at-fault party were worth (driver and insurance that directly caused the rental in the first place).   I'm certainly honestly concerned about safety, as I hope the **** never hits the fan, but you never know.You could argue you take trips to the mountains, maybe go on dirt or snowy roads, so you have to have AWD.  You could argue you need the creature comforts of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy.   There's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old Chevy Impala rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors.As to being insured for HPDE events, as of about a year ago, Geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy.   However, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an S4.  I think it's two entirely different concepts.  It's equivalent to if your house burns down and you have (loss of use housing coverage) putting you in a 4,000 SF mansion in El Centro, CA, instead of La Jolla, CA.  Equivalent to insurance companies, but not anyone else that lives in the real world."

In fact, if things hadn't changed I'd be right there with you.  My first car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT (bought brand new) which had a myriad of problems that concluded with the loeb of the camshaft (2nd from the top) completely wearing down at 61K miles.  For years I swore off GM and Domestics in general.  I'm sure I even vowed at one point (most likely on these boards) to never set foot in a D3 dealership again.  Durability and reliability have increased tremendously across the board.  Horsepower numbers are up (and so is weight).  Significant weight loss seems to be the next trend.  Each manufacturer does make a performance oriented car that given proper modifications will perform very well at the track.  There are very few cars out there that are ""no compromise."""

Also back then you got free maintenance for 50K miles.   I would say the '15 GTI has caught up to my old A3 in most ways.I'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30K for the A3 to nearly $55K (out the door) for the '14 S4.  If I was an entry level buyer today, I'm not sure the current A3 would do it for me.   I feel the '06 A3 was a better value and car for the time.  Essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level A3 is inferior to my '06 A3 in a lot of ways, plus costing more.

Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.I signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market.  The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.While I am ranting, I really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus.  Now, I'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.My belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.I am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.I hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn't to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the US -- stranger things, I imagine, though."

I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD.  Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal.  He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way.When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving.Once she got behind the wheel, that myth was shattered - the Subaru has the same height as our old Mazda CX-7. Same or better ground clearance as well.If only Subaru had continued to make the Legacy wagon ... that would have been perfect.Subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons.  First it wasn't a great seller.  Second was the fact that it's MPG wasn't that great and affected their CAFE number.  The Outback is considered an SUV and it's MPG doesn't count against CAFE."
1520,laurasdada,"March 31, 2015 8:53AM","I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches.""  My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo.  Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL).  I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time?  Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going.  Of course, ground clearance is another factor...But, my TL was just not as good in the snow as previous FWD'ers.  So, I bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at Tire Rack) and that problem solved.  I had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than AWD options.  Of course, then I want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the TL for the V8/RWD Jaguar XK.  With Summer tires.  My first RWD, a whole new world of no go in snow.  I mean, 1/8"" and I couldn't get out of my driveway!  Luckily I had the option of an AWD SUV...But, man plans and God laughs.  Life changes and I suddenly-ish needed a 52 week car.  Or a second car.  Logic and maturity took over, hence adios glorious V8 sound, hello sensible pair of shoes Jag XF AWD.  Could I have gone RWD XF with snows/rims?  Of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, I likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!).  But, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), I chose the path of least resistance and went AWD.  No worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.So, I pay for my laziness.  Need AWD?  No.  Glad I have AWD?  Yes.  XF was a champ in the blizzard I drove through last month on my way to ski Maine.  Sad said blizzard was east of the mountains and didn't dump any new snow at the resort!So, understand and choose your poison.  No ""wrong"" answer."

I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with  manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more..

The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact.  If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's.  These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller.  In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.Is there a debate about the ""maximum"" MSRP (base) for the full sized LPS's?It may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45K ceiling (for an RWD only version), but -- according to the BMW dealership here in River City -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are AWD.  And, here in our climate, I was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.The 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class.  MSRP ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.There are NO 335's with a window sticker under $50K, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. There are no S4's under $50K either -- but I have seen S4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50K.Likewise, I shopped the IS350 Fsports and they were ALL over $50K (if they were AWD).We need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.Those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP.  And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too.  I am simply arguing to be inclusive.Spend some time on the Mercedes build your own board and see how quickly the C class heads up up and away.  Even the ATS when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease.I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison."

Kind of puts those smaller ones at a disadvantage just because their manufacturers decided Americans were ready for smaller cars.The ILX doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.When the new 1 series sedan comes to market next year, then it will replace the 320i as the base model.  Soon there will be a subcompact Caddy and that will push the ATS out of the ELLPS.IMHO, Audi and MB didn't decide Americans were ready for smaller cars.  They decided that they couldn't keep the A4 and C Class that cheap.So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.As far as entry level, I'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. And I'd also argue that some vehicle from MB or BMW, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.JMHO."

Reviews of the Fusion usually put it near the top in handling for mainstream midsize cars.But you guys have answered my question......nobody can really give a good answer other than ""I don't think they handle very good"".  Nobody seems to have driven one based on perception.  But with 300hp, AWD and supposed decent road handling it still begs the question IMO.I think there is a difference between sportyish mainstream sedan, like Fusion or its plush cousin (more like stepbrother) and 328, A4, or TLX.  They may not be world apart, but the separation is distinct."

I think it is possible to have two models in same category, if they're not differentiated ad much.  It does look like C-class is intended to move up, just as CTS.  I think A4 is still in the class, both in size and price.Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB.As for the ILX, many would say the inability to have AWD as option precludes it from being an ELLPS.  If it were offered with SH-AWD, then it would be the starting point.Lastly, someone noted that the Fusion and MKZ are based on the European Mondeo.  That is incorrect.  The current Mondeo was introduced after the Fusion and MKZ.  The Mondeo is the exact same car as the Fusion and all 3 were engineered at the same time on a brand new platform."

They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about.And, as for the ILX being a tarted up Civic... if we use that as criteria, then we'd have to exclude many vehicles from this list.

1575,markcincinnati,"March 25, 2015 12:39PM","I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming).  This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS.The ATS is ELLPS as the CTS is [now] LPS; as 3 series is ELLPS as 5 series is LPS.Now, when the CLA and the A3 came along (and to a certain extent the ILX) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K.I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost.  Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.An ILX is an Acura.An ILX is a tarted up HondaA TLX has much more L + P than the ILXThere is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated?  Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.And so on.I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class.  I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars.  I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in.  This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold.This is getting difficult for me to keep straight.I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc.  I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines.  Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing.  Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other.  Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.My head hurts."

So from one side saying that $70K+ M3 is an ""Entry Level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40K ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition.  Classic eat the cake and have it, too.As I wrote before, to me ELLPS doesn't exists anymore.  Its original purveyors (3-series, A4, C-class) moved on to chase higher sales volumes from people with thicker wallets, their imitators moved into those leftover niches, but with their own philosophies and the category was stretched and fragmented.Basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters.  Their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50K, sometimes even $60K,  their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15K Kia or Hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part.  The market fragmented into too many sections and subsections for that category to be distinct.  Anything that size now can fit.The closest model to true ELLPS in last 10 years, IMHO, was probably Infiniti G50, especially in its first couple of generations.  The engine and suspension made it ""performance"", pricing made it ""entry level"", standard leather and other stuff made it luxury.  I'm not saying it was the best car for the money, but I think it was closest to the definition of that category."

1589,roadburner,"March 23, 2015 10:55AM","Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it reallywaslike going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitelynotfor everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than thisdefinitelyisn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect anunbelted160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course."
1590,markcincinnati,"March 23, 2015 11:22AM","$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit.  If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3.  Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS?  And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).$45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family.  The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club.  I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS.  Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the  ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days.  Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify.  Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities.  The range, I would think doesn't top out at $45K, frankly it probably starts north of $40K and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series BMW at the bottom and the M3 at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.This is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.I'm just not interested in an Impala or a Malibu, no matter how tarted up it gets (but I think they are styled pretty nicely these days.)"

A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club.  A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.If the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify.

The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate.  But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size.The part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of  Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define.  A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club.  A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.If the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify.  These are smaller LPS cars, and generally they cost less than their LPS counter parts.  That, I think, is why a strippie 3 and a fully loaded 335 are both ELLPS cars.I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."

With the intro of the ATS, I'd propose the CTS has been placed firmly into the 5, A6, E-class category.Just my suggestions of course.  I feel like Acura's big V6 & slick AWD system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.I agree with you about the CTS, but some of our own have scored these cars for many thousands off sticker which brings them firmly into the price class.Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment."

I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price.It will be $50K soon.  335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year.  435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation.  Also C400 is already above $45K.Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment:  S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more.  It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry levelplusluxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K.  One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6.  One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that.  This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions.  Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"".  ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. They'll usually have their own colors, increased comfort features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above.  They are in fact, their own models.  Call them ""poor man's supercars""."

Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances.  Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means.  Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture.  I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class.  If people buy it, so be it.I know if I were making twice the money I do today, I'd still be buying compact/midsize, but M4/3 or RS would likely make my list.

The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend.Granted, you might say the V6 Camaro with an automatic transmission isn't GM's front running ""track car,"" but neither is the '06 A3 for Audi, and it NEVER went into limp mode at low miles or being left unmodified.  Even modified and higher miles it usually only happened at temps above 90 degrees.Now why would GM make cars that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode?  The answer lies in previous model year rental Camaros likely BLOWING brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track.  Solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission.   Solution for GM (post BK by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode.  FAIL.Why on Gd's Green Earth would you rent a V6 Camaro with an Automatic Transmission and take it to the track?  The auto enthusiasts that track their cars are so few and far between that they barely register on manufacturers' radar.  You want a Camaro suited for the track?  You local Chevrolet dealer will gladly sell you a Z/28 Camaro.Why on God's Green Earth?  I'll tell  you whySome idiot in a Lexus RX 350 sidelined my 4-month old S4 by darting out of a parking lot (in an apparent left turn at exactly the wrong moment when I was going straight; colliding his front left with my front right).He sidelined my S4 with less than a month to go for a track weekend, a track weekend I didn't want to miss being that I had missed the previous one with the club for other reasons.Hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a Buick Lacrosse.  Given the choice between a Camaro RS V6 and the Buick, well, it was no choice at all.   Really, they should have saved the C250 Benz for me.  Most people at the track said a Focus would have been more fun to drive.  I didn't end up having much fun, as the Camaro is too heavy.   Next time I'll specify a Focus.Gotcha.  I remember your S4 getting hit, fixed, fixed again, & fixed some more.  You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new.Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day.  That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you.  Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track.  I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track.  I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track.

When it comes to undetectable codes I can only go by what I have read by many on bimmerfest,Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though.

Throw in the C Class and A4 for good measure.Can you really say that a Dodge Charger with a honkin' Hemi with probably the best GPS in the biz, real leather, all the safety gizmos on the planet can't really be considered a compettor to an M3?  Just because the Dodge is less expensive, does that mean it isn't built as well, using as good or better materials than the German rivals?  It seems Mercedes is trying to convince everyone that their vinyl is somehow superior to leather.  Nice try, but I've felt it, smelled it, sat on/in it.  It's not as good as leather, regardless of what the marketers say.I think it's expanded.  Buick could sneak in there.Acura TLX?  Sure.  ILX? Debateable.  Q50?  Yep.  Q40?  Well, that's just a renamed G, which is well past its expiration date.Lexus IS?  Why not?  ES?  Sure.  NX?  CT?  Not so sure about those last two.ATS?  That's the ELLPS darline right now, so that's definitely in.A4\S4...Yep!A6/CTS/E Class/5 Series?  Probably slotted above any of those that have already been mentioned.I don't even know anyone....even a remote someone...who owns an Infiniti M.

1626,markcincinnati,"March 22, 2015 10:42AM","One response: concerning the IS but not the ES.  The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance.  There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole.""  The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me.The possible reason for [my] not including some of the cars in the fold is that they don't offer much ""L"" or ""P"" or not enough to notice.  The Buick Regal, was an oversight on my part -- since it can be somewhat low on the P side, but so can an A4 or a 3 series -- I do think the ATS is a better GM example of something that can be included as a full on ELLPS, but I think I will give the Regal at least the designation as a Near-ELLPS.The action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ELLPS or NELLPS -- sure there are better Luxury cars and better Performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ELLPS offerings; but if you have a $45K-$65K car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ELLPS designation.Since LPS cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, I am less and less tempted by the LPS models out there.  I do wish my S4 was a bit bigger, but the A6 occupies just way too much real estate these days.  I am hopeful the next gen B's from Audi (B9) figure out how to be about 10%  bigger overall.But, I wouldn't kick an S6 outta bed for eatin' crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers."

That year, Lincoln led the field. Before 1998, Cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.Since Mercedes grabbed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. Lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. These days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. BMW has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing Mercedes and Lexus.Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....Acura finished sixth in the U.S. behind Cadillac in 2014 but has jumped past Audi and Cadillac into fourth place for the first two months of 2015, demonstrating just how hot the competition is among the aspiring brands...."""

They're ""this close"" to pricing themselves right out of the ""it's not worth what I paid"" category.  Given no clear advantage for performance, quality, reliability, that's a dangerous place to be.Not sure if they're still offering leases that are heavily subsidized or not.  But, GM learned that lesson long ago.  You can't subsidize forever.Don't get me wrong.  I like BMWs.  But, when a 335ix tipped the $60K+ scale equipped the way I like, and the 235i came in close behind, I could see that the threshold had been exceeded.There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are  much less.My sentiments exactly; I've owned 10 BMWs-from an E24 M6 to an E83 truck-over the past 32 years and I completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new Bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(See: HIDs, enhanced Bluetooth and USB connectivity, decent ICE, EHP summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.)."
1662,markcincinnati,"March 10, 2015 3:18PM","billyperks4said:""There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are much less""Which???The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on.  There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500.  Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped.  My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction.  I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4.  And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab.  Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate.  But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.We have met the enemy . . you know the rest."

Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of  consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity.  I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so.A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. So I think I am a purist, just one who thinks RWD (or FWD) and stick shifts are so 1980."

1665,graphicguy,"March 11, 2015 4:55AM","WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions.  Yeah, they are fun.  But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual.  Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price.  Yes, you can special order them.  But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one.  They're out there.  They're a acarcity, though.Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans.  They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons.  I've driven an ATS, several times.  They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range.  Good looking and built well with great materials, too.I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others.  Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate.  Still, can't argue its performance.Acura TL SH AWD Advance?  Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change).  I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement.  But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now.    It's a lot like the Acura TL.  It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories.  At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too.  It's design could be polarizing, too.  But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.I understand people being polarized by the styling.  But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity,  sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance.  They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series?  From my perspective, yes....lots of them.  My reasons may be different than yours, though.  You start loading one up to knock on the $60K+ door, and that list grows dramatically."
1666,markcincinnati,"March 11, 2015 7:24AM","In·ev·i·ta·ble:  unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation.  By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train.  You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming.  It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it.  You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car.  But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving.  We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone.  Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity.  So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport.  It did not come with seatbelts.  The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late.  What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving.  I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress).  I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH)  and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated.  I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas. Hell yes, gimmie a car that I can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile I work on my iPad mini catching up on my [State Department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: The small, precise, or trivial details of something.At least if I’m in my car, not having fun driving it, I can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.“Oh, what a world!

1667,markcincinnati,"March 11, 2015 9:39AM","My wife calls the differences between her last car, an Infiniti and my last car, an Acura, a lack of soul. I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors.  The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking.  The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling.  I don't know if I would call the Acura's feel something as negative as ""OK fit and finish,"" perhaps I would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the Audis (or BMWs) we've had.If that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it.  Please remember I am not saying I think the Acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. I also thought the SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel tire package made the TL elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an S4.I, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an Acura TL or TLX when there are cars like the S4 on the market.But, if you read my previous post, in probably doesn't matter since most cars will be nearly autonomous before the note on your new car is paid off."

The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales?  They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature.  WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether.  See my next post.Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus.  I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+.  Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. Even the 2015 Stang GT is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..But there is something to be said about putting the top down in a big block muscle car and cruising the beach."

1685,graphicguy,"March 5, 2015 6:12AM","BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road.  Fun to drive, though.  The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses.  It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version.  Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many.  But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.I do think RB is right.  There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.Then, there are those who just don't care.  They just want a BMW or a Mercedes.  They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive.  They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.Not saying any of that is bad.  Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive.  It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road.  It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions).  It's relatively quick.  And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life.  And if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out.  They get good MPG to boot.  So, there's a lot to like.TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet?  Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look.  Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however."
1686,graphicguy,"March 5, 2015 9:23AM","Mark....bravo.I have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points.  Manual transmissions......frankly, I doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos.  That's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics.  Same goes for MPG (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big MPG numbers a necuessity).Personally, I'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around.  Efficient?  Not hardly.  Heavy and unwieldy?  Yep...pretty much.  But, that's what I'd like.Point being, to gather market share, the BMWs, the Mecedes, the Infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle.  ""Let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so I can get noticed.  The rest?  Performance?  Handling?  Who cares?  That's not why I bought this car.""  Those are the customers in this segment, now."
1687,markcincinnati,"March 5, 2015 11:04AM","dino001said:I generally agree with you, Mark.  I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements.  There is no deal, if one gets not what they want.  I also totally understand BMW's move.  Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh- perhaps ""eccentric few"" would be more polite.  Unfortunately, both average Joe Sixpack and Joseph Broker want a car ""today"".  They can't fathom waiting for one a few weeks.  So dealers and manufacturers run their business for those guys' pleasure, not mine.  I already feel lucky, when I mention a special order, I get a quick nod from a salesman saying ""no problem, all we need is XYZ"", rather than more typical deer in headlights looks.While I acknowledge BMW's right to do what they think is best for them, I also reserve myself a right to [non-permissible content removed] a little, if their choices differ from my preferences - just like with any other product we buy.  There is no law saying we have to be ecstatic every time we buy something.  Sometimes we buy a compromise - I venture to say most of the time.  Ultimately, I know I have to adjust and get something closest to my ""ideal"" product.  Doesn't mean I can't express in places like this, what I would like to see, or why I think that product is not available.OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions.  For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model.  Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model.  Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what?  I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear?  Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby.  Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats.  You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist.  If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it.  What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites.Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!""It gave me such great pleasure when I came home (from my first quarter of college) for Thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (I turned it up to 11):""You need coolingBaby, I'm not foolingI'm gonna send, yeahYou back to schoolingWay down insideHoney, you need itI'm gonna give you my loveI'm gonna give you my loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta love""They don't make music like THAT anymore, eh?Nothing Gold Can StayP.S. Lunatic fringe is preferable to eccentric few if you axe me.I remain: Often wrong, NEVER uncertain!"
1688,dino001,"March 5, 2015 11:27AM","BTW, I disagree with all this mess being MY fault.  Don't look at me, I did my part - all my cars, but one had manual transmission. I got a manual, I got sport suspension, I insisted on a factory order with everything I wanted, not the sales manager thought I wanted. So I did my part, yet they still changed that because others didn't. In other word, IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE at fault, namely all other self-described ""enthusiasts"", who couldn't wait six weeks for their car, or had thousand other excuses (my wife won't let me), so they took what was on the lot.  So yeah, I will [non-permissible content removed] a little...BTW, I can't get 335 in a wagon.  I can get it in a 435 Gran Coupe and that one is likely going to be my next car, unless I decide I can trade the price.  I also can get 335 Gran Turismo, there is even a nice demo available today, but the steering is just awful.  Can't bear it.NOT MY FAULT, NOT MY FAULT"

Tons of the x and a few more sport coupes but I want the sedan although the coupe is the looker of the two.
1693,tlong,"March 6, 2015 12:27AM","graphicguysaid:TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet?  Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look.  Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however.Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.-I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years. It stays reliable at 150K, still looks good and drives well, I put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. I did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137K and spent about a grand. I figure that is ok given the mileage and it was my most expensive repair on the car."

I am.  Are you talking about WOXY?Yes I am a Miami Alum, too and actually a Miami Merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from MU, worked at WOXR (not OXY) as the program director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week.  We WERE for about 6 years the only prog rock station in SW Ohio.  Those were the days. OXford Radio (OXR).  I have no idea why the name was changed to OXY.When I went to Miami, no cars were allowed unless you were married or until you were in grad school, so car commentaries weren't even on my radar.  Actually did my Master's work (which used to be called a thesis, but by the time I was there it was called ""independent reading"" which was, so it seems, about 10x the amount of work as just taking a class would have been -- I mean I felt like I read the entire freaking library for pity's sake) on how mass-media (when there was no Internet) helped win World War II financially by getting people to buy the bonds that funded the thing. And, in 1976, your final act before getting your Master's was what was then called Master's Orals.  As far as I know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree.  Back then (1976, before you were born probably), you had to sit in front of three PhD's and the Dean and answer their questions and spar with them for about 90 minutes or so, so they could determine if you knew your subject matter.  Probably helped that I was a DJ since talking was how I made my living (such as it was) at the time.Too bad I don't get paid by the word, I'd be rich!"

I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich.  I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory?  He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars.  I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money.  Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait.  We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city).  I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K.  At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather.  I also wanted all-season OEM tires.  My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white.  I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted.  I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted.  What was I thinking?  That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory.  The reason?  The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in.  Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid.  Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful."

I passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me.  I passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.No Porsches for me.I had exactly the same experience when I visited a BMW store in Scottsdale in 1999, back when BMWs were BMWs.  Haven't darkened the door of a BMW dealership since."
1700,dino001,"March 9, 2015 7:39AM","graphicguysaid:Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. (...)I can see the allure for the dealership.  No floor plan to pay.  It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want.  And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars.  As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles.  I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there.  At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger.  Rather than three engines, you get something like eight.  Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options.  Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books.  We enjoy lower price at expense of choices,  limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture.  They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege.  To each their own, I guess.BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics.  When I was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), I was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical European store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category."

Most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, I would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the CA's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.Now on a side note, my CA informed that BMW has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding M5's, So this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease.a $52K 3er without Xenon Headlights?

1705,benjaminh,"March 1, 2015 6:43AM","The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....2016 ILX base$27,900 msrp0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)hp 201trunk: 12.38 speed DSG29 mpg comb2015 Audi A3 1.8$29,900 msrp0-60: 6.5 (C & D)hp 170trunk 106 speed DSG27 mpgEach one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX."

Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong.There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand.I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with.  The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence.  Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance.Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live:  Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago.  It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class.  Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past?  Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots.  Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak.  Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming.  No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL.  The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day.  The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect. I think were I somehow in a Bizarro world shopping for an ILX, I'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest VW dealer and look at a new VW CC R-line instead."

Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me.""  Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.The folks I [superficially] socialize with at either the BMW Store or the Audi Connection here in River City, actually seem to be very much into Audis and BMWs and cars in general.  They know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the BMW or Audi family.""My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.I'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious.  I've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.But, I could be wrong."

Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer.  Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:http://acurazine.com/Even though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity.

1712,graphicguy,"March 2, 2015 3:31PM","My track days are over.  But, I still like a good handling car.  I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are.  There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago).  Just not so much any more.These suspensions have become quite sophisticated.  I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura.  They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.I also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement.  I had a Saab turbo in the '80s.  That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go.

1713,roadburner,"March 2, 2015 8:22PM","I have to say that I reallydidlike Acuras up until the ""Beak"" design theme emerged- the RSX in particular.As for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was averynice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.I also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood..In contrast, an enthusiastat the very leastknows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.Sad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland."
1714,graphicguy,"March 3, 2015 6:41AM","RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else.  I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen.There seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it.  Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra.  And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated.  In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4.  But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them.  Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way.  Thanks but no thanks.I really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS.  The Mag Ride Control is the real deal.  Never thought I'd say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is.  It's just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.Still, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack.

The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me.  I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us.  Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior.  I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.)  The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me.  My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of.  The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done.  Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place.The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4.  The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series.  These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance.  When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1.""  There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6.Those $70,$80 and $90,000+  4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad.  Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie.  The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. I think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."
1718,nyccarguy,"March 3, 2015 8:09PM","@markcincinnati‌Sorry for the confusion in my post.  I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door).  While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning.  The car was just perfect.  It fit me like a glove.  At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it.  I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love.  An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service.  I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd.  Nice cars.  Very smooth riding.  I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower.  The chassis seemed to be stiffer.  As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on.  The car felt very disconnected.Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be.  Waxing poetically about their respective BMW.  The truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the BMW brand."

1720,flightnurse,"March 3, 2015 10:25PM","I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K.  The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one.  But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative.Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people.  I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ.This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. Since all GT's are xDrive, we are getting the Dynamic Handling Package this allows to have greater control in the x Drive cars when either the Sportline or M Sport lines are ordered (Rick is getting a Sportline GT.)"

Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....2016 ILX base$27,900 msrp0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)hp 201trunk: 12.38 speed DSG29 mpg comb2015 Audi A3 1.8$29,900 msrp0-60: 6.5 (C & D)hp 170trunk 106 speed DSG27 mpgEach one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX.I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition.  Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot.  In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight.I know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realistic comparison in my mind.

But I really do like the reliability of my Acura.Imagine if you had access to a great relatively lower cost Audi mechanic or two, that could have properly diagnosed the issues with your old A4 on the first attempt only replacing the parts that actually needed replacing!  I have access to such a mechanic and it's part of the reason I love Audi so much.   Incompetent, or worse, dishonest mechanics can end up costing you a lot of money."

Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot.  In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight.I know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realistic comparison in my mind.  Hey, I compared a TL-AWD to an S4 and opted to pay nearly $15K more for the S4.As you say, by the time you fully trick out an A3 2.0 it's c. $42k. It's no doubt better than an ILX premium in many ways, but then again it should be at that price. For $42k msrp you can get an Acura TLX 3.5 V-6 with SH-AWD and the Advance Package, which has some features not found on the A3, plus quite a bit more room for passengers and cargo. Not everybody wants to pay $10-$15k more for a comparable ca, but Audis are no doubt great cars these days—in looks, performance, design, and features...."

The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.I guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.Personally, I think Honda got away from what they did best with Acura.  That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical.  RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade.  As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road.  The new one is better.  Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise.By default, they became a luxury SUV company.  It seems past those who view an Escalade as having ""made it"", the MDX is the lux SUV of choice with the upper middle class.  I still like their products.  Whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars.  I hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my Acuras were.

"" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months.Here is what we noticed:  Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes  owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners?  Not so much.So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands.  Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say?  Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours.  The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies.  Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.As the sign at the BMW dealer reminds: ""Don't Forget to Breathe!""Me?

Since my car has been pretty much flawless, I think I will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues.   It's already a beast; should be fun.I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5,  S6 and S7, for instance.  Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic.  The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine.  The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life?  If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line.  It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern.I'm not worried about it.  When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one.  Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless.  Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque.  I'm not too worried about it.  I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."

It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone.  I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.My wife swore (and I couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her TT were chip related.We traded the car in for a newer TT with the FACTORY upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.Summary:  good luck and godspeed with your upgrade.  I'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up S car without any post OEM help."

From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. Offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twisties in Northern California's wine country."""

1788,graphicguy,"February 10, 2015 6:03AM","Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX.  Wife tried one before settling on the Accord.  Tough sell.  Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord.  Hard to make that fly.I did like the TLX.  But, I didn't like it as well as the TL.  So, no go there, too. RLX?  Should have saved development money and killed it off.  It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had.  Troubling enough it was on the dealer level.  Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better.  That attitude eventually catches up to you.  You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.S3 will sell.  Not sure the age group.  It gives a lot of performance.  But, those it's targeting are raising families.  Is it big enough?  For $50K is it really nice enough??   Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out.  The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car.  And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""?  Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride.  My money?  Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles?  I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money.  Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.BMW?  Cadillac?  VW?  Any of those dealers close?  I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's.  Interior is....ummm....interesting.  Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series.  But, it has a star on the front.  So, for many, that's all that's needed.I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor.  It became troublesome almost immediately.  When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable.

One second faster is a pretty significant difference.When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2016-acura-ilx-drive-review"

I admired it back in the day.In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.And when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there."

We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference).  I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again.  The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership.  I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.Went to Dayton Audi store, too.  They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"".  After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store.  Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.BMW Store is good.  They never seem to have what I want.  They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart.  They seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains.  I tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which Sweeney always seems to have. I have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at Sweeney BMW, though.  He's been there for probably 20+ years.  I've bought 3 BMWs from him.  Deal is always skinny, and simple.

However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless).  Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G?  No way.The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location).  Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat.  Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to.  But in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this S4 is as new-feeling at 22K miles as it was with 22 miles.That's the story so far."

So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation.

But, then, I also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and I think, nah baby nah.I at least like the concept and notion that my S4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) AND durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.) The standard state of tune, I'd wager is more likely to have that characteristic.

The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads.   I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too).  I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power.

BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals.

An expensive lesson...  But back in Oct I took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... My service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, I currently have 21500 miles on it. So not too sure what to make of the service indicator..

It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit.  They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof.  If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured).  If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion.  The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.I do not believe that ALL new  BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact.  But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past.  BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission.  However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.Dammit!"
1830,cdnpinhead,"December 27, 2014 8:04AM","The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world.  Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum.  If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning.  Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire.  Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.It's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available.  I choose not to participate, and I don't think I'm alone.  The majority on here seem to think it's wonderful.  Party on."
1831,markcincinnati,"December 27, 2014 8:57AM","The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government.  The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat.  The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6.  Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers.  The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003.  It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like.  The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market.  We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).Yeah, I know, I'm preaching to the:Use itUse it upWear it outDo without. . .crowd.But, whatever one likes is certainly one's prerogative.

This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.I wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way I wanted it, if I could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones I'm interested in.  I think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the ones that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick.  I'm told one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube.  I could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with what's available here.Wow! That's variety.  My question is this:  would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US?  And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US.  My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the  range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."

1834,graphicguy,"December 30, 2014 8:29AM","Sorry FN....just saw your question.  Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.I got the CTS AWD Performance version.  The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal.  Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions.  It has its own version of torque vectoring.  These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating.  Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available.  I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns.  Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey.  Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me.  Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town.  It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.All the gee gaws.  It took a few days to get used to CUE.  But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen.  Touch controls work.  Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers.  You slide just above the metal bars.All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real.  Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS.  I got into one for about the price of a middle of the road A4, TL, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.Yes, it's new.  Yes, I'm enamored with it.  Pretty darn happy with a car that's made in Detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the E, A6, etc out there."

Don't know why.And to be fair, the new CTS is priced right in line with the cars that GM sees as its key competitors: the Mercedes-Benz E Class, the BMW 5-Series, and Audi's A6.But Cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. Meanwhile, BMW and Mercedes buyers aren't (yet) flocking to Cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference.In other words, Cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. So, why isn't Cadillac trimming its prices?Not long ago, a price cut would have been GM's response. But these days, Cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime Audi executive Johan de Nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."

The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.

And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO.I look at a CPO this way.  If I am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, I will go 3 on a 2 YO CPO.  Payments end at the same age.  So the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since I am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)Plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments.  Though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years.That's what we do; we've had our newest car(the CPO E90) for 2.5 years and will probably keep it an additional 3-5 years.

1857,graphicguy,"December 19, 2014 2:23PM","markcincinnatisaid:graphicguysaid:I've tried to like Infinitis for a long time.  Every time I look at them and test drive them, I'm disappointed.Assuming the Q70 used to be the former M chassis.  What's the point of going from one letter to another?I know they did make a drastic price cut of the former G series, and that may be saving their bacon.  But, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.I just don't know where they are competing.Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names.  They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle.  I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family.  They had to settle for one new car, the Q50.  The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37.  I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version.  To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top.""  The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me.Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm.  If  KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.Today, the Germans seem to betheaspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.)Merry Christmas all.Mark...as always, I like reading your posts.  And, can't disagree.  I also just realized that LG has a TOTALLY different connotation than the old GoldStar brand, even though they're the same company.Best to you and yours!"

If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new.

Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi.  The differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the Germans.My wife puts it this way, ""The Japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul.""  This from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a JD) who hates it when improper grammar is used.The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy.  The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.Frankly, even the new Volvo products bear a good long look.Our guess is the Japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's SQ5 Prestige now is approaching 30K miles and still feels new.  We'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50K, but things look good."
1873,graphicguy,"December 10, 2014 9:11AM","Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.I look at my former TL SH AWD and remember what the first one I drove of the current gen was like.  Not sure what Acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the TLX came out.  Most of what they did, you couldn't see.  You could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.I have a CTS now.  It iOS light years ahead of anything I've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.Over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much Mercedes has changed over the last 5 years.  I know for a fact that the E92 BMW I had has been changed immeasurably  (some say improved, some say not) vs the F3x versions.Given your experience with the S4 vs my experience with the S4, it sounds like Audi quietly addressed their (what I considered major) issues.The march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking."
1874,roadburner,"December 10, 2014 10:40PM","nyccarguysaid:A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS.  We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet.  The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version.  The RWD has an 8-Speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the AWD?).  It is old school for sure, especially compared to the other 4cyl turbos in the class, but tried & true none the less.Body - yes you can call the IS polarizing.  It's grille even looks like The Predator.  It's looks are very modern.  The car does stand out in a crowd of ubiquitous 320s, 328s, C300s, & Audi A4s.  I like the charcoal, split 5 Spoke wheels.Adaptive Suspension - many of today's ELLPS are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions.  The IS350 F Sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.Now back in 2006, I attended a Lexus test drive event and was able to drive an IS350 back to back with an E90 330i.  Now the IS was MUCh faster (butt Dyno), but BMW took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo 335i.  I thought the BMW was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension).  Things are different today.  The BMW still puts up good numbers (328i & 335i), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive.  Maybe the playing field has evened out.The emphasis has shifted from driving dynamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. I guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Cheap Trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."

My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest.

1905,markcincinnati,"November 25, 2014 5:35PM","Some quick (for me) follow ups:Equipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60's. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more.  My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit.  We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW.  I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60.  Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure.  Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche."

(all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K).  Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker.  But $50,000+? Nah.Keep on driving it like YOU live.  I couldn't live with this car -- dammit!"

1918,markcincinnati,"October 26, 2014 10:44AM","S4 M3Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short.  If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom.  And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family.  Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . .""  My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.I'm driving it like I (at age 63) live."
1919,dino001,"October 26, 2014 4:46PM","It's hard to find a legitimate ELLPS below 40 grand.  There are some nice ELLS below 40 k, but they lack the ""P"".

1922,markcincinnati,"October 31, 2014 11:16AM","I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point?  Things have changed in 12 years.The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C classareELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and  ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3?  It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class.  But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up?  A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it?  A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released.  A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc.  So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway?  PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .Yeah, that's the ticket.Almost forgot: Boo!  Happy Halloween!"

1925,markcincinnati,"October 31, 2014 2:21PM","The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD.  The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.The X3 however felt like it was on rails.Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road.  I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most).  Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel.  As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed.  The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.)  The new one plows and crosses the center line.  The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too.  But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.The X3 was the natural -- were money no object, the X3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""

I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers.  I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina.I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.You two, indeed, drive it like you live.  I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great.

We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and  MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.With the Model X and E coming school and the price dropping, who knows I might have one. The model E is to start at about 45K.Between San Diego and Phoenix a long highway 8 one can see the charging stations and these are the supercharging station which can charge a Model S in under in 20 minutes half full these are free.. ,"

This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series."

No extra charge.

People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin.  This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD.

What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch).  Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"".  That is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days.The only cure for this velocitization is to get an A4 2.0T loaner for a day or two, so I can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my S4 -- I've just gotten used to it so much I take it for granted.Drive it like you live."
1987,markcincinnati,"October 6, 2014 8:24AM","sweendogysaid:Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days.  With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure.  Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think.Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP.  Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there.  For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque.  Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet.  The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US).  This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of  an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.Program note:For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers.  I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama.  The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.Dizzy with the rush of speed, I leave you saying ""Drive it like you live""!"

And it keeps recomputing in realtime as I am driving. It tells me if alternate routes will be X minutes faster or slower. Maps are always up-to-date. It has information of road closures, accidents, everything I need.And since it is on my phone or my computer (same Google maps), I can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and I see the same route in my car.With Ok Google Now, I rarely need to type in the address or destination. The voice recognition is pretty good and I can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations.The phone connects via Bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. If I have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions.And all of this is Free.I don't think I can every go back to factory installed navi.I do the same.  Google maps and OK Google ... It's great and I'm not going back.  Same with a back up camera by the way.  It's a must for me now.I just wish they would let bluetooth stream the map/route to the cars screen so I wouldn't have the need for that suction cup thing on my dash to hold my phone."
1989,graphicguy,"August 27, 2014 12:52PM","Here's the latest on Apple's ""CarPlay"" (Siri integration).http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/apple-carplay.htmlStill trying to figure out how this will work.Via Bluetooth, I can already use my iPhone's phone functions.  I can also get the spoken Buetooth directions through the TL's sound system via maps.  I can ask Siri questions and get answers via Siri connected to bluetooth.So, if they're planning even more integration (say, just having a screen where an iPhone displays it's maps and bluetooth where the directions can be heard), I'm thinking onboard Nav systems may be a thing of the past."
1990,markcincinnati,"August 27, 2014 1:29PM","I think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by BlueTooth streaming from (why not) a smart phone.  New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone.Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology.  And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality).Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile.  I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen.  Even 3G isn't all that great.Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.)  There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case.Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier.Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere.Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be.  Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory.  Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car.  This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque.  Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc.I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered.  More like what IBM does with some of their hardware that can be upgraded for the end of month processing -- for a fee and then returned to normal for the routine daily processing of data."

1995,andres3,"August 28, 2014 6:43PM","@flightnursesaid:What been the outcome in getting the insurance company to give you diminished value on your car?I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August.  It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)?  claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4.  Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K.  They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K.Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV.  They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim.I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount.  Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses.   I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total.  They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked.  I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help.I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand.  It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given.Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable.  I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report.  One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse.  Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be.Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K.  The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point.  No lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15K property damage claim.Next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot."

2006,markcincinnati,"September 9, 2014 7:36AM","Another One Bites the DustThis is gettin' serious now:""Nissan Plans to Make Autonomous Driving Common by 2016""-- Motor Trend, October 2014; Pg - 26You know what Pogo said:""We have met the enemy and he is us.""Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small.I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as tocustom ordernearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift.Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear.  So what?  I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both).  This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks.  I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City.The point?Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken.But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome.  Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one.Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions.  A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for.On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis.I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself.I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself.  Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much.The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp).""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.""Drive it like you live -- but do drive it yourself."

Audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this S4 at the factory.  They obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a MM or two.This last visit was to correct inconsistent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced).I drove a new NON SH-AWD 6 cyl. TLX and wasn't impressed at all.  The transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny?  Why no exhaust?  Why less HP than the outgoing TL SH-AWD?   This is your Camry/Prius-like TLX.Perhaps the SH-AWD is another animal?  Admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking.  I heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter.  NO NO NO Acura... no no no.Oh, and the moon roof cover is cardboard covered in vinyl.....compare it to the S4's and you'll believe me that the TLX is an overpriced Accord."

The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine.Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power.

Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors.The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec.  The S3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the S4 is quciker than Audis published claims.The Audi Connect is 3G -- it sucks (if it is T-Mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.Objectivelythis is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.If you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the Acura TLX V6 w/SH-AWD and in Advance trim -- consider it a bargain S4, sort of.And: drive it like you live.Remember, this post is certified 100% objective, there are no opinions, zero, zilch, nada in this utterance."

Voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use Pandora.  Second, it's a marketing push.  With Pandora in the infotainment system like Sirius/XM and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising.I have Pandora on my phone and never use it in the car.

Priced here in the ELLPS pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ELLPS (wishing they were, I assume, an LPS, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, I'd imagine).If I thought I could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, I'd pass on doing that, at this time.My wife and I must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100K or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.Seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and I grant I could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.Think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; I'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- A LOT -- well you probably give the new eatery a go.  The characteristics of the ELLPS and LPS ""buyers"" is (I've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). You like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto).  True dat?I also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.Well the challenge I'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ELLPS and/or near-LPS).  Make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- HAVE to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves.Even if it's not an Audi."

I leave for work in the AM and I punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two Interstate highways that I may have to travel.Wait 5 seconds.The screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that I must travel to get from sub-urban Cincinnati to the CBD (where I need to be).  If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.I also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.Hell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey.To each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS's and LPS's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.I was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.A Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".)  It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.Hence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live.  I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.Besides, I wouldn't pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death."

First off audi interiors are amazing and this a6 was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. Nice highway cruiser - but a bit of a boat in the turns. Pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. Infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. I drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if I was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.Other observations - sat in an A3, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and I would certainly take a look at this car if considering. The layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. The trunk also huge for a compact.S6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.Glad to have the s4 back- small puncture fixed in rear tire."

Bought it outside the servicing dealers'  territory.Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati.  I saved $4K on the car by doing that.    Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country.I've bought enough cars to understand what happened.  You're probably right.  There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that).However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees.  They acknowledged there was a problem.  They said Audi had a fix.  They never did, or if they did, it didn't work.  The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way.  Both said it was a problem.  No one could or would fix it.  There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding.At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue.  I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it.  That said, I would imagine this does happen.  There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them.  But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed.  That must have been in their fine print somewhere that I missed.Don't get me wrong.  Not taking it out on you, Robr2.  You've brought up a lot of bad feelings I had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than focus their energies on fixing my S4.

Hardly the reference work to use to get an overall picture of reality.  Living in AZ certainly doesn't give you a lot of direct knowledge of the nations snow tire use either.   Do a lot of people that live in snow country which also run summer tires on sports cars also change to snows in winter?  Probably.  A majority?  Who really knows.  But even if a majority of that group does, that still says nothing for the other 99%.   Definitive statements need facts or direct relevant knowledge.My reference of Bimmerfest was just a sample, and I never stated other wise. But modern cars today that are RWD have the elec nannies to make them drive-able in the snow with the correct tires.

Traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree.  The nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users IMO.I think there are small regions in the N.E. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas.

2077,markcincinnati,"August 12, 2014 6:13AM","The new Car & Driver tests the almost here S3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ELLPS family).  The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4.After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces.I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury.I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to.My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room.  Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger.The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff.  Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so.One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive:  the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."
2078,stickguy,"August 12, 2014 9:07AM",I sat in an A3 a couple of weeks ago.  The rear seat was way too cramped for me (leg room OK but way short on head room.)

Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it. Again, people who want a bigger car then S3 will move up to a S4, I'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the S3 that you can get with the S4."

Sitting in the back seat of an A3 is not something I would want to do, granted -- but I'd rather not have to sit in the back seat of a current A4 either.Now, then, that comment might suggest Audi will enlarge the A4 -- I guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an A4L in China (at least) to be sure.Making the A4/S4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, I think (I have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the A3/S3, just the competition from the market itself."

The other one was white with black interior.The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment.  All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack.The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans.  Fun drive.  The DCT performs extremely well.  Steering is light, and precise.  It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear.Gun it, and it leaps.  Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs.  It's as roomy inside as my TL.  They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs.  Maybe.  Not sure.  Plenty of rear seat room.Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs.Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout.  Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands.Dual screens...top one for NAV.  Bottom one for audio and HVAC.  This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl.The V6 was a FWD Advance.  It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven.  9 speed push button trans.  It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear.  It will snap to any gear firmly....right  now!Great seats, very high quality materials.  Super quiet.  Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed.Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car.  Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried.I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s.  Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors.  These just seem to want run hard.P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go.I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K.  Not sure about the 4 cyl.  That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything.  A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.They had two demos (which I drove).  But had sold the 4 they got in stock Last weekend.This car is going to be a hit.  Plus, the headlights are really cool."

Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes.  Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing.Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS.  Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas.  I didn't experience that.  Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in.  I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl.Are they the fastest?  No.  But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES.  Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field.  And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance.But, the suspension is where the car really shines.  It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven.  It trumps BMW and BMW's own game.  Ride/handling is superb.Acuras are notorious for holding great resale.  I can see this trend continuing.  It is now back on top the tech heap, too.  Good looking interior with high quality build and materials.In short, it feels much more expensive than it is.Can you tell I like the new TLS?"

2101,justg0,"August 6, 2014 8:48AM","Acura's model is giving options standard that BMW and Audi charge for, and for a much lower price. I purchased the revamped MDX that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one Acura had introduced with sh-awd. Paid under50K for fully loaded. Similarly equipped BMW and Audi were north of 65K.  There were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that MDX best in terms of handling over X5 due to sh-awd. Not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. I still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance.That said, it still does not compare to driving a RWD BMW for me. I will have to drive a TLX to compare to the 320i that I just got.Here's another review of TLX -http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tlx-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6.

I guess if that seems dangerous you can always spend a little more for the 328, or a chip.Stick, the 320i goes 0-60 in 6.7 sec, faster then a Hyundai Sonata Turbo or Kia Optima Turbo that have 274hp. Stops from 60-0 in 106 feet. Overall I'm happy with the car, and extra boost added has given what the 320i needed. Now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially BMW has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the 328i is also getting a power boost too.Now the new M3/4 are nice cars, but are they practical?

I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan.The coupe felt like a different car.  The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i.  But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL).  It was smooth.  I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology.  But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have.  Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW.  Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths.  The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW.  I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too.  It's not as fast on an absolute basis.  But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you.  It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.Materials.....very nice.  The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather.  Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL.  Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again).  Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura.All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW.  Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals?  How can you use one without engaging the other.  They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity.  Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind  BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura.  The Mercedes took forever to boot up.  Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz.  Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.So, to sum up.  The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND.....It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW.  Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too.While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost.  From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost.  Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance.

The new 3er is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i M Sport over in the Pre-Owned lot.Pathetic story of the evening: I'm looking at 328i Sport Line and a salesman asks me what I think. I tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics-I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'dnevertake my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it."" My son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""The Dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all I could do was silently pray: ""Dear Lord, deliver the BMW marque from all poseurs.

It's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I've driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I've never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive.

I leased the S4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles.With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability.My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that.  The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?""Sit down:  Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off.  The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped).  And, hey, it WAS AWD (I assume, after all, it was a Jeep with an AMC Concorde body mashed on the frame) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather.  This was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that I was -- I took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too.Taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. I couldn't wait to be able to afford an Audi -- got my first FWD one in 1977 a 1978 5000.Anyway, I guess I am at a point where I really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- I get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go Acura or Infiniti.I'll echo, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who I asked ""why not get another Infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?""Her reply: ""Infiniti ain't got no soul.""In short:""Cutty says 'e can't hang!""(Airplane -- jive talk scene)http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jiveTold you I'm old."

My second assignment to Germany saw me getting a 318i.  Great little car until it learned that I'd pay for electronic repairs.  It seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed.    In the US, I had 2 diesel rabbits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop.  Lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death.I won't even go into the UAW-built cars I have owned.  I will not even consider buying a car built by the UAW.  Since going Japanese, I have been most happy.  Very reliable!  I think I'm going to stick with Japanese.  My wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at Infiniti and Acura.

Perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crisis (not sure they could have if they wanted to).I love BMWs (x3).  I love Acuras (x3), too.  They're my two favorite brands.  BMWs have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions.  They can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation).  After that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time.  Those charges are more than what I've experienced on an Acura.Acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a BMW).Can't say one is better made than the other.

Fairly accurate and reliable. However, I still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. Now, my 2011 335i 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. I find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. Comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage.Regarding the German vs. Japanese car comparison, both my Acuras are great vehicles and I will not trade them. However, my BMW gives me a smile each time I accelerate around a turn. The interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts.Sorry for the long post."

Anyone that says ""bmw[sic] is deviating from their core customer"", just doesn't have any common business sense.My 2 cents!So in other words, it's a smart business move for a marque that has built its success by striving to be ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" to build overweight numb steering luxo-barges while several of their direct competitors(Audi, Cadillac, Lexus) build better BMWs than Munich. Allow me to quote Peter M. De Lorenzo:""By selling something acceptably agreeable for all, it’s all but guaranteed that BMW will fail to elicit passion from anyone.Which makes it official: The poseurs and in-house cynics are out to destroy BMW from within."""

2180,justg0,"June 8, 2014 12:33AM","For some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g.  Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is.Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW.  What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. And there is no way a Sonata can match BMW in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. If you care all about HP, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a BMW with similar or lower price tags.You can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. I lease my cars, so I am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. And you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. I totally understand that I am ultimately paying for that experience and I am fine with it.You basically get what you pay for!"

2185,markcincinnati,"June 9, 2014 11:32AM","The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1)I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact.“ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .”We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS.I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too.The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits thatused to bealmost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”.  But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century.  Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”.  Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance).Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus?I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”).Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)? Does said Regal GS merit an invitation into the hallowed ELLPS category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"
2186,markcincinnati,"June 9, 2014 11:34AM","The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2)Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)?Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next).And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly.Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, orour kind” [of car] – you know, allowingthemin here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible).So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club.Why? So they can raise prices, natch.Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative.For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”.The ELLPS category is more alivenowthan at any other time in history.  At least that’s the way I see it.Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
2187,markcincinnati,"June 9, 2014 12:37PM","I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing.  I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file.Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply.  Well, my my my how things have changed.  I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too.Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject.  I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""!  Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"".  FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time.On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all.  Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy).  There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class.  Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD.  Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD.  At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change.The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected.Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"".  We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say.Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary.  If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance).So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought.I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8.I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8.""The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. I'm operating under the assumption that this ELLPS forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more  hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."

The acura TLX is one that I've been waiting for, but have recently had some concerns.  Although not a scientific sample, I've spoken to 8 people who own the TL (2007 - 2012), TSX (2010 - 2014) and MDX (2014).  I had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the accord - wind noise (that is one of the reasons I bought a Toyota in 2010 instead of another accord - wind noise).  Every one of the people I spoke to said they had wind noise from the windows.  Is this a fluke or is this representative of what I can expect if I buy an acura?"
2198,wayne21,"June 12, 2014 5:54PM","Thank you, sweendogy. I had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura.  My wife doesn't want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise.  In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford.  In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota.  I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing).  Wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we'd step up.  I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable.  I'm not interested in hearing wind noise.  I'd think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise.Cars I'm considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don't care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car).  I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan.  The venza runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I'd buy it.  (Car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a voteso I think I'll wait to at least look at a maxima before buying, but I'm not sure when they're coming out - I think Sept."

2201,roblaw,"June 15, 2014 7:28AM","@roblawsaid:Sorry Wayne, it post too quickly.  I had 3 accords and have a 2012 Genesis.  Hondas were great cars but had terrible road noise.  I think the most recent Acuras have done a lot to reduce road noise (I do not remember the wind noise in my Accords as the primary source of noise).The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still.  But you have to know what you want.  The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis.  The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats.  It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis.  It is probably almost a foot longer.  I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage).It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend.  Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped).  This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump.So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is.  I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars.  Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?).  There is an amazing array of great cars in the TLX/Genesis price range that meet a wide variety of needs.Good luck with your purchase."

In my 135, at least, those weak points were vanos solonoids, brakes, and very poor stock engine/trans cooling. Moments of fun with everything working in synch were brief, so I de-modded it and traded it before it got really expensive.Was the JB4 the only mod you did?  So far I haven't had any issues with the car, and we are coming into summer, it was 110 today in Phoenix... I think the stage 1 is good enough. 220hp is just right for this engine."

2215,markcincinnati,"June 4, 2014 1:49PM","Miss a Few Days and You Miss a Lot!Well I last posted on May 29.  Whew!  I think I am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.I have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts AFAP:Talking with specificity about cars you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, I will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2.  Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%.  Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason.  If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible.Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""Continuing:In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's.  That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more.""  Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort.I like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here.I'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are BRUTAL!DILYL"
2216,markcincinnati,"June 4, 2014 5:35PM","I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag.  But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch.  A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60.We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile.  Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac.  I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars.We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc.I was wondering today when the last time I saw a Phaeton was -- years ago is all I could come up with.  Saw several A8's today, however.  I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton.  The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc.  I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see.  Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing.Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?""You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better).  Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda.""  Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status.My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air.  My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new).  My wife must get 6 new pens per year.  I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty.  I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf).Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom.  It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.Remember the Phaeton, long live the Phaeton.You know how to drive it . . . ."

2219,markcincinnati,"June 5, 2014 10:37AM","Sween,Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers.Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc.If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it.  The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means.  These cars, I think we all mostly agree,arebetter ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to.We may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why I say, most of the time, ""Drive it likeyoulive. . . ."""

2221,markcincinnati,"June 5, 2014 4:17PM","I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned).  Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc).  I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do.  If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that.The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest.  Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers.  Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me.  And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded.They can't keep the A7's in stock.  If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales""if you axe me!""I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself.  Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""Of course, I am often wrong, but seldom uncertain.To anyone who interprets anything I say as being rude either in intention or execution, I apologize.

Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper.  And it's all good.There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS?  Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not.  Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what...  The line will always be blurred and they move.  Yesterday's luxury is today's standard.  Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick.  Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K.  And so on.  If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them?  They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares.I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS.  There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide.  Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury.   Then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses.  There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS.

I'm not knocking the 320i.  I had one as a loaner once.  For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine.  Around town I found it comfortable and docile.  It rode smooth on the highway.  I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi.  I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers.  I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard.  I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1.  I was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an X1 28i vs. a 320i and an X1 35i vs. a 328i.I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors.  Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options:  Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint.  We loved it.  The fact that BMW offers a 320i with a dedicated RWD platform sets them apart from the competition.I think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg.  Around here, the cars all have X Drive and an automatic (I know why, I took my Prelude yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day"").  A Sports Package around here with our Texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.There are faster cars in the price range (Sonata Turbo, V6 Accord) for even less money.  There are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too.  Just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all."

BMW had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what I like.  The exhaust note more throaty than I remember on 335 I drove during the performance delivery in Spartanburg.  They also had 428 Gran Coupe on display.  It's gorgeous.  Back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. Love the looks.  Couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction European model, even had manual transmission, not available for US market.

Handles better, looks better, is faster.  Almost 335i fast, in fact. Those full leather Recaro seats are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme.  So if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.Or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. Auto magazines compare the 335i and the G37 routinely.  I think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model G37.It's not that BMW doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that Lexus did with the miserable IS250.

I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0):Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more?That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI  and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city."

I must say, I rather believe a guy who actually drove it and wrote that article that said this 320 reminded him the old 325 he actually owned (which has been basically a benchmark defining the category in its balanced design), rather than a guy who looks at some number tables and proclaims the thing not being worthy his time.BTW, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 M3 (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""?  Sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far.  It is true that the competition honestly caught up with BMW in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it.  It is a new reality.  Over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that.  Consumer is the king.  BMW themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal.  But I simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ELLPS should be, it doesn't belong.  Until I actually sit inside and try it, I don't know."

Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive.  But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion.  Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down.  However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of  a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with.   Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it I don't need it or if I don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"".

When Mercedes first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in America (by serious, I mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, AC, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former Lincoln and Cadillac owners.What was that?  It was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or  ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"".What the American drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."
2267,markcincinnati,"May 28, 2014 12:31PM","Been so busy for weeks!  Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles.  Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version.My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic.In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground.  Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon.  Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down.In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt.  Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact.When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to).  The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt.  The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves.The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.)The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool.I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio).  Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile.  I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis.That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars.BTW - went to the Porsche dealer:  finally they had ONE Macan S in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd I thought goth was dead (I crack myself up).However, we do want to drive the Macan to see how the SQ5 holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar.As always, drive it like you live."

Offers from Porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the SQ5, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the Macan does cost more.  The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K.  My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S.I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche!  And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE.I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up.I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5.  Either Audi needs to up the ante (an RSQ5 perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky.Funny, Audi has registered the name RSQ3, but as far as I can find out, NOT the RSQ5 -- can you say ""Marketing!"""

Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles.Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease.Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.)I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money.  Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge.But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.)Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper.

It's the same F30 as the 328i which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the Audi and MB can not claim.

The only thing that is questionable is the ""performance"" part.  But it appears the A3 will perform just as well if not better than the A4.  I think that was the hang up with the TSX being included in that it didn't really fit the ""performance"" model in a lot of people's minds.  I had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of A4 w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a TSX.  I know most people think of the Quattro when they talk Audi ELLPS but that's a choice of their own.Doesn't really matter all that much to me.

At first, I wasn't sure I liked the LED headlights, as Acura is using them as a design cue.  They're starting to grow on me, though.  Looks like the tailights are the LCD ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my LED tail lights.

And if the vehicle isn't quite right after all that effort; what then?Basically looking at near $30K or 60%. Still, too low to total, but my opinion is generally that cars are unfixable from significant accident damage. Maybe this body shop will change my mind; I'm hoping!I have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, I had to make a panic stop on I-8 west bound from La Mesa to Mission Valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6K miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new frame, cost of said frame, $7900, then another $13K to R&R frame. My EX and I fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete....  So after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time I would take the truck out for a test drive I would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck.

Doesn't your S4 have an aluminum frame?>The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components.  It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right.  They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs.  I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way.""  There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County.  A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec.  They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right.  In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays.  I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail.  After all, they didn't settle for a VW.The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?)  After that, he said they   had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked.  They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk.  I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone.  I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs.  I told them if they force me to go further, I will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now I might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.If there are ongoing issues with the car, I think now is the time to state for the record I thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning.  At least then I can say ""I told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate)."

I'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so I can eek out a ""betterment.""  I will gain no benefit.  If your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once.I can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is AWD and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear."

In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty.  However, I wasn't expecting the following:Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess).Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint)  They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany.  They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory.  Looks aftermarket now.The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips.Number 3 bothers me the most.  They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse.  Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side.  The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work).  I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close.  When I eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two.Andres....Just my personal opinion, but I think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed.

The SH AWD will still be available but it's significantly lighter than before.Interesting to note, the new TLX is supposed to be a 1/2 second faster to 60....pretty significant. That puts it smack dab in the middle of the lux/performance cars we always talk about here...like the IS350, Audi S4, BMW 335i, Infiniti G/Q.

2333,markcincinnati,"April 14, 2014 12:59PM","Acura TLXThere are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior.The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too.  And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics.I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $).  Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall).I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings.  It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration).Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan.  This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one).  Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine.  But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models).Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like""take the 'P' out of ELLPS.""I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.)In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX.  The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain.DILYL"
2334,graphicguy,"April 14, 2014 1:23PM","Mark...as always, appreciate your thoughts.Of course, the proof is in the pudding.  We won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (May?).  My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when  a new model comes out.  They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc.  They then have some of the new models for brief test drives.  Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love).You're an Audi aficionado.  I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine.  That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.I'm an Acura aficinado.  Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few.Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture.  Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer.  Still, day=to-day driving?  You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car.  They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for.While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always.  Sticking to the formula of Good/Better/Best (standard/Tech/Advance) I just confirmed with the dealer that the Advance I'll be looking at will come in right around that $49K range (current Advance is $48K and change).0-60 in 5 sec, Torque vectoring AWD, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, LED headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, integrated NAV that actually works right (and Siri enabled to fully integrate my iPhone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price?  Yep, it's at the top of my shopping list."
2335,markcincinnati,"April 14, 2014 6:25PM","Is there anyplace (on the  web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found?  I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue.  The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not?I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%).  I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura.In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots.  Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago.It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.Of course, well, you know . . . . but never uncertain.Drive It Like You Live."

2338,markcincinnati,"April 15, 2014 4:47AM","Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife.  The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved.  If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem.Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns.  Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc.  So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win.  Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly.  On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.Once there were 88, soon there may only be one-quarter that number [sic]."
2339,dino001,"April 15, 2014 6:43AM","@markcincinnatisaid:Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?The short answer is no.  The long answer is no.  They don't care.  As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved.  Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work.  Moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance.  My observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product.  So it goes like that:  what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, I dunno notin'."

Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"".  How is this possible?  The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty.  What's to authorize?  You fix it.One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother.  This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new.  Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY.It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week.  It kept draining the battery.  Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery.  A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough.  So, she and I swapped cars.  I drove her Caddy every day.  Same thing happened when I drove it.After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"".  I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained.  He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after  the surge.When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed.  Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother.Know what?  So am I.  That attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since."

Obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but I think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the Lexus ES and other fwd rebaged cars should not.
2344,markcincinnati,"April 16, 2014 7:48AM","A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth?This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum.  There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale.The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars.I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me.  I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped.Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum.Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum.The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model.For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3.In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.""Move along . . . these aren't the droids we're looking for."""

I've only had my car for 2 weeks- will say with snow tires its a bull. Hills and turns not an issue even in 6 inches of loose snow. The car with snows is noisier then the old G was - but it does get 4-5 mpg better in my limited time in mixed driving. I drive mostly in individual mode- I set the exhaust to be dynamic (infinit standard),  steering dynamic and engine in auto. I've also set the speed limit alert to 80mph as its very easy to miss given the small readout- I've also found the digital speedo to be extremely helpful- I have the V1 hard mounted near the passenger visor as well. Excited about the car and a bit worried about the German gremlins that maybe hiding."
2353,markcincinnati,"February 27, 2014 6:59AM","@sweendogy:I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto.  I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to.I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively).The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound).Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade).  Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course.  In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control.It is a little thing, perhaps for some people.  But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight.Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55.  With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself.I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control.In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control.

2356,dino001,"February 28, 2014 10:56AM","I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority.  At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"".  There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price.  It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"".  In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option.To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars.  Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands.  When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such.  When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it.  Detroit (GM especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing.  They'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. ABS on Cavalier), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it."

To be fair though the American companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( Chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and GM with ABS in the Cavalier as already mentioned, and I think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( grand ams for instance).  At least there is no longer an Americans car to hat I know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike Toyota).  The eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all.  And why just pick on the American manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the Japanese ( and even the German ) mainstream line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up.  And Chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the American manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand I do agree that their high end models ( I.e. Cadillac and Lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the German makes, and I don't recall that happening  so in that respect you are correct."

I didn't get the job because I questioned the way I'd be paid.  It was to be a $200 per week base and then I'd get paid more based on a CSI score.  I asked how my pay would be affected if someone's iDrive crashed before try got their survey.  That was a chance I couldn't take living in Manhattan trying to support myself.@qbrozenMy Dad had an '07 X5 which was the 1st car BMW introduced with the ""beer tap shifter.""  One morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see).  The ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it.  He lifted the hood and everything looked OK.  He fired the X5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore.  So he continued on his way to work.Now I have to tell you that my Dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 Great Danes.  He keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner.Anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 AM, and my Dad's X5 literally shuts off in the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge.  I'm cleaning off my Prelude getting ready to go to work and I see he keeps calling me.  Maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)?  I listen to the voice mail, he says:  ""call me, I'm stuck on the bridge.""I call him back and he tells me the story, then asks:  ""how do I get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?""  He checks the owner's manual.  Without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out:Remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""T"" key from the spare tire compartment.  Stick the red ""T"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twist to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed.Just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the Hudson River on the passenger side).  Open the rear lift gate to get to the ""T"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the X5.  The tow truck drivers from the NYS Thruway Authority can't help him because every time they try to help my Dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb Great Danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys."

2391,markcincinnati,"February 25, 2014 2:31PM","5,000 Miles Down the RoadA friend of mine, a marketing executive for a national software firm, always buys BMW’s and claims Audis are exclusively for “left-brainers” (I started out life as a computer programmer, so maybe there is something to that) because they appeal to technical types (tech-weenies, to quote my friend); you know these folks, those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas, but also who can write actual computer programs as well. My wise-guy friend claims, even though Audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” Audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. They (Audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports.Although I, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt Audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, I now present an S4 update now that I have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads.The Audi in question is an Ibis white 2014 S4 Premium Plus model with the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, MMI/Navigation+, B&O audio, Magma Red Napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, Audi side assist and Audi Care. I guess, perhaps I even wish, I would have gone for the Prestige model, now that I think of it, just for the articulating headlights. Of course now that I know how inexpensive the sport differential is, I should have insisted on getting that, too. With shipping and Audi Care, the pre-tax price was $57+K.  As a member of the Audi Club of North America, I got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an Ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax.  I put no money down and leased the car.  I plan to buy the car and the Audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. I believe there is a way, too, to CPO my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles.At 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles.First off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. Even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 F), starting was no problem and since I have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature discomfort. My butt was quickly warmed up, that is.Second, the S4 with the S-Tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration.  The engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. There is no latency: Press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car I have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecondbeforemy brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed.  The paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when I ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, I could ever pull off. And, I should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if I had hit a giant, super-thick foam rubber wall. Finally, the S4 goes where you point it, when you point it. Body roll is minimal and it corners like a Ken Onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast.Other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high RPM upshifts, the S4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the B&O speaker system is sick – although I do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the Acura TL’s DVD-Audio system.This year, Drive Select is standard, and it allows, in Individual mode, the driver to change the characteristics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. Settings generally include Comfort, Auto and Dynamic. I have mine set for Dynamic (engine/transmission), Auto (steering) and Comfort (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in Comfort mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts.I have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s SQ5) to the track, but wrist-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds.  To me, the S4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; I’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. Time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an S4 – something I do attribute partially to the wonderful (Red) sport seats. Nobody does sport-seatsbetterthan Audi.In sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick S4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. I will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles.Perhaps because S4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them  at any of the Audi dealers I’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. This is a pity, for the S4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of American’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. If your auto shopping list currently includes an Acura TLX [coming soon], BMW 335, Infiniti Q50S, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, Mercedes C-class or Volvo S60 Type-R, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an Audi S4. If money is an object, I would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming TLX, assuming Acura keeps the S4-lite theme of the current TL SH-AWD alive and well. Or, you could get an A4 S-Line and have many of the same goodies that make the S4 such a treat.I’m getting the heck outta here now, while it’s still light out, and I’m going to take the long way home.DILYL"

OK, OK, not literally another actual car, rather the Audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer.This 2014 Audi S4 is like every other Audi I've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger.We've had the worst winter here in SW Ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and I felt no need to swap tires. The all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems.My wife's SQ5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my S4) has 20"" Continental Extreme DWS all seasons (UHP too) and she's has no traction issues either.

I'll bet any repairs on an S4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.)I finally saw my first SQ5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first Q50 at long last.

I didn't have engine or transmission problems, but I suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.)My subsequent Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 A6 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid.Since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 A6 3.2, 2009 A4 2.0T and my current 2014 S4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the S4 though) to be reliable. My 2005 A6, which I kept to about 66,000 miles as I recall, also would make me say ""durable."" Yet, these days with several of the Japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66K miles hardly is proof positive.One of the people I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series and he did buy the extended SERVICE package when he purchased the car new.  This was NOT a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy.  After 50K miles, these German cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.)Audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car CPO'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use).  After 100K miles, however, you're on your own.Here is the thing my friend has found with his BMW -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years.  Then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at MAX was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently.  So, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that.When I get in his 2005 BMW, I can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 Audi S4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own.I'm looking forward to the latter -- even though I do love to keep up with all the new-tech.I'm driving my wife's 2014 SQ5 Prestige today -- wow, in some respects I like it better than my S4!  Of course the S4 has the S-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.DILYL"

However, Volvo frequently throws those in, sometimes thousands - which makes ED price is not so great, in comparison. Unlike BMW, Volvo's ED pricing is non-negotiable, like all others, it does not include incentives - however, you sometimes can get an extra discount (usually $500 or so) on certain prebuilt models waiting in Sweden.  And you still get the ticket, one night at the hotel and the dinner, and you can have a free car rental for couple of weeks.  It is worth something, if you plan to go anyway."

I'll lease something like an Accord or Subaru Impreza 5 door and share it with my wife for 15K per year (when she drives the new car, I'll drive her Pilot or my Prelude when the weather is nice).

2461,cdnpinhead,"January 21, 2014 6:14PM","@dino001said:I think people's wish to have MT diesel is simply misguided, based on what is not available and never tried.Well, I guess you told me.I've driven seven different diesels with manual transmissions (not counting my '71 KW with the RT910 Roadranger) in Europe between 2001 and 2013.  I enjoyed each one and generally try to avoid complication in my vehicles.  Manual transmissions rarely fail and cost significantly less to repair, plus which I can shift when and how I want, including skipping gears or changing my mind in the middle as traffic conditions change.  That said, it's clear that BMW knows what it's doing, since there appears to be universal acceptance of what they're peddling."
2462,dino001,"January 22, 2014 7:31AM","@m6user:Well, I guess, our priorities are simply different.  I'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience.  My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction.  I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary.  Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money.I consider current 328d a first BMW's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity.  I think the 8AT is just right for it.  I don't think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings.  It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn't hear of massive failures of those BMW's autos.  I may be misinformed, of course.The background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance.  It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband.  The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations.  Today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last.  The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine.  The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive.  To be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels.In the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people.  Only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not.  Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel.  Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel).  That advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be."

I guess your equating both our return to Audis (or German cars in general) to the ""economy"" is perhaps somewhat (or more than somewhat) true, too.Yet, to be more transparent, I think it is also acccurate to say that the Japanese cars we had were (quoting my wife: ""passionless"") even though they were worthy of being described as ""premium"" class.I had so wanted the Q50 to be what its advanced press promised; and, if you'll recall, I custom ordered an IS 350 F Sport in Ultra White with a red leather interior, AWD and a bunch of options.  When my wife ordered a Q5 3.0T, I tes drove the S4 and thought it to be ""beyond reach"" even though it was clearly able to outperform the IS in every way (including price.)The Audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming ""home"" to Audi a no brainer.  So yea, the economy observation does ring true, but not the whole story.Regarding the length of my posts, well, I once again have something to go on about.I do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an S4; you may find, as did I, that an S4 is ""within reach.""Until next time: Drive it like you live!"

They are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up.Long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here.Since I'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going.  BMW, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars.  I suspect most will like that.  Personally, I don't.  But, looks like it's helping them sell more cars.  Same can be said for the Infiniti Q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new Q50.  Shame.Benz is going for high style.  I saw pics of the new C class, and drove the CLA.  I'm guessing the new C will drive similarly to the old C.  Nothing compelling there.  CLA shows Benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics.  Seems to be working for them as they just surpassed BMW as the U.S. luxury car sales leader.  Not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy.Audi keeps marching to their own beat.  Good for them for doing it.  To me, they are the performance leaders.  Owning the S4, and having had A6s for extended periods of time as loaners, I can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics (reliability needs lots of work, though)If there's one place Acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept.  They've got the engineering down.  Their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid.  I don't hold out much hope that the upcoming TL(X) will be substantially different from the RLX is style.  I like it, most don't.  That said, it does feel good to just have such a capable  car do everything well, without worry of hiccups.Wish I could think of a pithy saying to close with.  Can't.

Infiniti's strong point in this segment with the Q50 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price.  The 3.7L VQ most definitely will not be as smooth as the German sixes.  I would say Infiniti's V6 is smoother than BMW's N20 2.0 Turbo 4.I wondered what happened to the forum, since I stopped getting message, I see a whole new look..Since having my 320i now for 3 months, I can say that the smoothness is an issue, but since I have upgraded the ECU to the stage one, the extra power has really transformed the car. The harshness doesn't bother me at all,  The 320 still have the feel of a BMW, the only positive that the Q50 has is the VQ engine, but that engine has it's issues too."
2480,nyccarguy,"January 14, 2014 7:49PM","@flightnurseGlad you (and presumably Rick too) are happy with your 320i.  My car is in for service and I got a brand spankin new 2014 328xd.  This is the 3rd new body style 3 series I've driven.  BMW seems to be trying (operative word here) to inject some of its ""ultimate driving machine"" magic more and more.  I actually like the new 3er more and more as a commuter.  While the steering is still too vague for my tastes, the ride is comfortable & taut, the 8 speed automatic is well matched to both the 4cyl gasser & 4cyl diesel.The diesel is a bit harsher than the 4cyl gas 320i & 328i.  As expected, mid range torque is fantastic, but the most impressive thing of all is the diesel's fuel economy.  A green engine (the car had 9 miles on it when I picked it up) is showing between 39 & 40 mpg average.  Literally almost double what I get with my 2011 328xi."
2481,markcincinnati,"January 15, 2014 7:38AM","The new Acura TLX (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand.  I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible.  I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda.For years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around.  The result has been beneficial to both brands.The new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned.  The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti's aspirations.  Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming.  I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later.The IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down.""Now, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong.  Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim.Despite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura's S4, and a high value vehicle, too.So, here's hoping Acura's glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""):""These are the days, the time is nowThere is no past, there's only futureThere's only here, there's only now.""Get 'em while they're hot.And, drive it like you live."
2482,dash5,"January 15, 2014 8:11AM","I'm with Mark on the new TLX.  It's definitely on my list of ""must try"" as of now.  Of course that is pending reviews.  As far as looks though, great.  The talk is all right on track for me too:  performance, quiet cabin, tech.It's still got plenty of hurdles to clear though.  I'm picky with interiors.  I love Audi in that regard.  I certainly prefer Honda/Acura to Toyota/Lexus interiors, but we will see what we get here.On top of that they will be contending with the upcoming  A3 sedan and the CLA.  I'm glad to see this new class being competitive!"
2483,markcincinnati,"January 15, 2014 12:47PM","The SH-AWD version will have the 3.5L V6 and a 9-speed dual clutch transmission, at least I think it said dual clutch (the 9-speed I am sure of).My 2012 TL had a 3.7L V6 rated at 305 HP -- which, these days is close to being too little (unless there is a big torque number that comes on at relatively low RPM's).  I would assume Acura has goosed things appropriately all the way around.With respect to the interior -- well, most folks did not and do not seem to make favorable comments about the ""button-happy"" interior and steering wheel.  Once I got used to things, it never really bothered me, but the 2012 interior was not what I would call ""premium"" -- it seemed like, well, TOO MUCH Honda Accord DNA had seeped into it.Looking at the Audi interiors often spoils [most] people for others interior treatments.  I count myself as one of those so spoiled.I am, however, confident, that Acura will probably get the interior right this time.  But wait -- it is probably going to be very much like the RLX, which has been recently criticized for still being too busy."
2484,graphicguy,"January 15, 2014 1:52PM","@stickguysaid:that spy shot of the TLX did look sharp.  Not worried about the interior.  They seem to have been doing a good job there.I am curious to see what they do for powertrain.  Since it is replacing the TL and TSX, will they go with a 4/6/hybrid?  Turbo something?Will also be nice if it frees up the ILX for a power boost.  Basically use the 2.4l on a mid-level AT model, not just the ""hot rod'.  That IMO will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick.  Keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade.I believe Acura was pretty early to the 300+ HP V6 party.  I know my Mustang GT SOHC V8 had 300 HP less than 10 years ago.  BMW is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 HP (albeit I suspect that's under rated).  The Lexus (x)S 350 V6 is right at that mark, too.  The Infiniti V6 in the Q/G sedans have more HP, but are down on torque compared to the Acura V6.Audi uses a S/C on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer.  Their 4 cyl is 220HP but is torquey.So, I think Acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 HP 4 cyl and a 310-320 HP V6.  Again, 8 sp DCT or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too.Mark, I don't think Acura gives up anything to the Audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality.  Like you, I've owned both.  Still say the ELS sound system in the current TL trumps the B&O system in the S4.I'm into my new TL for at least 2-3 more years.

But then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...I've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry.

Plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo Audi s4.

I would say that CR is good at the collecting of a good sized sample which makes them a very good resource for objective data (such as reliability and one would think durability, too.)Generally speaking, ""everyone wants to be Audi"" -- or so says at least one or two ""Car & Driver"" type magazines when they wax poetic about auto brands in recent months.Remarkably too, Audi's cars keep coming in close to the top or at the top of the heap in comparison tests.  Most recently the A6 3.0T schooled its most worthy competition and even beat the new CTS (and the CTS's target was the BMW 5, which, in this case it did beat -- but so did the Mercedes in the test.)Since everything does go in cycles, I would say, even with my considerable bias, ""this can't last.""  Now is the time to make a move and get the Audi before it begins what -- eventually -- will be ""slippage.""  Moreover, if you want something that has been modified and modified and slightly refreshed (last year) meaning it is perhaps the ""best one ever,"" I would think you would be hard pressed to build a better mousetrap than a 2014 A4 OR S4.  Now, I may eat my words, but my '14 S4 is an absolute joy to drive.  It is damn near a ""masterpiece.""How I hope that the S4 may be tested (as was the BMW 3) against everyone's favorite newcomer -- the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport (my first choice in this class when I thought the S4 would be out of reach financially.)In any case, the new Q50 seems to have missed the mark if you believe at least 3 auto enthusiast magazines and CR, so your choices are somewhat limited unless you want to re up for a new (last MY) G37X/Sport.Now may be the time ""to Audi.""But, like I said, I'm biased -- often wrong, just NOT uncertain.DILYL"

2508,flightnurse,"December 4, 2013 8:41AM","So I haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in Tucson.  On my trips down and back, I have been averaging 36 MPG, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. The traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. Before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go.So for thanksgiving, I went over to San Diego to see my dad, I-10 west, through Palm Spring, Riverside, and down the I-15 to San Diego. Weather was clear, temps in the mid to high 60s for most of the trip, no A/C needed. Average speed was 75, I averaged 38.5 MPG (car trip computer), however, when I filled up the car took 12 gallons at 460 miles (38.3 mpg), on the way home, temps in the upper 70's to low 80's A/C average speed 80, 37.5 mpg (cars trip computer), 465 miles used 12.5 gallons which is 37.2 mpg. So the car's trip computer is fairly accurate in the MPG.So a few thoughts on this car, I have 3800 miles on it (much higher then I thought I would have) but this is the nature of my work.1)  The start/stop feature, it is unnerving when you first get in the car and it stops. You get the WTF just happened. Now having the car for 2 months, it is second nature, doesn't bother me at all.2) Power, the car is rated at ""only"" 180 hp, but in my daily driving and highway cruising, the power band and torque are set that one would be hard pressed to tell, my last rental was a 2014 Sonata, and while the standard engine make about 200hp, the 320i ""felt faster"" then the Sonata's. BTW, I just ordered the Stage 1 tuning kit for the 320, 30hp gain and 40 lbs of torque gain for $375. stage 2 is in beta test but from the prelim testing, on a 320i stage two add's another 20 hp and 30 lbs of torque for another $175. MPG is not to be affected at all with these upgrades under normal driving (well see about that.)3) Handling and ride of the new F30 I read people's comments about the steering feel of the new F30, granted it does have the weighted feel of the E90 or the current 1 series and X1, but in daily driving one is really hard pressed to know the lack of feedback.  I'm sure on the track it is a completely different story. The ride of the non-sport F30 is typical German, well controlled without it being too harsh, now, my E90 with the M sport pack and run flat tires wasn't so bad if the road was smooth, but as we all know, not many cities have ultra smooth road, and that combo get's tiresome after a while. Do I wish for better supportive seats, YES, but over all, no real complaints. I was not tired at all on my trip to San Diego, my first stop is always just north palm spring which takes about 4 hours to get, no sore butt or fatigue at all.Has BMW last some of the edge that the 3 series had, yes, BMW was always more of a ""sport"" sedan, then a ""luxury"" sedan but the people with the money (buyers) want more luxury which is fine, but I think BMW can make both sides happy without really compromising too much, I just hope they find the happy medium.Some grips about what has become of the 3 series, when building a new 3 series, the only two interior color one can get with the sport pack is black or red. If you want other colors you have to get the M sport pack, Luxury model or standard. I wish the enhanced bluetooth and alarm was standard.With that being said, I like the 320i, it does want I want it to do, the price was reasonable and the resale value of the 320i seems to high on it, but time will tell."

2512,markcincinnati,"December 18, 2013 2:15PM","I had sent this ""privately"" and now I figure what the heck -- perhaps there is some merit in these remarks for others, too.At $55,000 (net), you can easily get into a well-optioned 2014 Audi S4 Premium Plus. Clearly I don't know what would impress you -- and if this Audi doesn't do it for you, you can load up a IS 350 F-Sport and at full MSRP be @ less than $51,000. Of course of the two noted above, the S4 is the real performer with its sweet supercharged V6.The torque steer is something to overcome in the Volvo S60 T6 (Type R) but it is tough to get this car OVER $50,000. It may not do it for you due to the obvious FWD bias, but it is worth a test-drive if you're in the market at this dollar amount.So, while $55K won't get us into the SUPERCAR realm, we do have a number of choices that will stay under this price cap. It's a great time to be in the market (the $50K+ market) if you ax' me.DILYL (and Merry Christmas)"
2513,markcincinnati,"December 23, 2013 12:45PM","I have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I did suggest that I understood and largely agreed with the July '10 Automobile comparison of a TL (SH-AWD) with an Audi S4 (with the sport differential – Audi's torque vectoring rear diff).Refresher(from Automobile, July 2010):  “You probably never thought of the Acura TL SH-AWD and the Audi S4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence.  . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.”“In a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the Acura and the Audi are significantly different only in the details.”Now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 S4 and after 40,000+ miles with my TL, I can offer my 2¢ more.First, let’s get the “as owned “ MSRP’s out there.  With rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (UHP a/s's) and splash guards, the TL SH-AWD Advance comes in a bit south of $48,000.  Approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the S4 Premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without Premium paint, which could have added additional $, had I selected one of the many optional colors offered.) My '12 Acura came with the color called Bellanova White Pearl while the Audi I configured was in a glossy hue they call Ibis White. A metallic white option on the Audi would have added another $550 to the MSRP.If you’re keeping score, the Audi starts out about $10,000 more than the Acura similarly contented. But simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the Audi seem expensive, a perspective I have come to believe is untrue.  As the Automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” Never a truer statement was said about these two cars.  And, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the Acura.Indeed, considering its performance & content, the TL SH-AWD Advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and I mean what I say only about the SH-AWD Advance version – what I say should not suggest I would make these remarks about other TL configurations). Perhaps were I given the opportunity to test a TL with both SH-AWD and the manual transmission, I would change my opinion.The Audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the S4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more.  The current heart-throb car, the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the S4’s; in fairness, however, an F-Sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 MSRP barrier.There is, currently, no BMW 3-series M car (if you don’t include the 3-series” M” convertible, starting at $69,050, which I am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily sail through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the S4 would be incorrect, the BMW M would be more accurately compared to an RS – not S – Audi car.Back to the TL vs the S4.  Both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points.  The Acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the Audi’s performance. And, for the money asked, the Acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ELLPS category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling).Here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the Audi S4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do iseffortless.  From the S-Tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a secondbeforeyou ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the S4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like Green Lantern’s power-ring, I suspect.In contrast, the TL SH-AWD is not quite as much the natural athlete as the S4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the S4’s performance out of the TL, you have to work at it.  Here’s one reason why: the TL’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the Audi’s and the TL’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher RPM’s (the TL's V6 is naturally aspirated vs the S4's supercharged V6). The consequences of less torque attained at higher RPM’s twisting through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the Acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. While doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless.Another huge disadvantage the TL has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. The Audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts.  Coming to a stop, the Audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that I doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to.In the final analysis, the 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance isa lot of car for the money– and I would still call it Acura’s S4.  For $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its unique styling and busy button-laden cockpit.)  I had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what I assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25K miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which Acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the Acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles I assume most cars on the market today would still seem young.The 2014 S4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the TL in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to.  The S4 does seem more substantive than the TL – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface.  The Acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the Audi, the TL's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the Audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb.If you’re looking for the TL to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. Virtually everyone I know called my TL, “Mark’s Honda.”  Truth be told, the main problem with the Acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much Honda” in it. Some years ago, Audis were sometimes said to have “too much VW” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate Audi to separate themselves as much as they could from VW. Thus far, Acura’s are often thought of as “Honda’s who know somebody.”More’s the pity, for the TL (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an LPS car.  I can recommend the TL SH-AWD Advance for its likely street price (I got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is comfortable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle.It didn’t inspire much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built tobepassionate. The S4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. Even after a crappy day, driving the S4 puts a smile on my face.That’s my story . . . and . . you know.DILYL"

While we were filling out the paperwork on her SQ5, I commented how much I would rather have the S4 than the IS, but that the price of the S4 made it seem to be constructed out of unobtainium.Days later, Audi dealer says -- I can get you a white S4 S-Tronic with magma red leather and the blind spot warning (which was a deal breaker or maker option) -- and we think, with no money down, we can meet the Lexus' price since you are now eligible for the Audi loyalty discount (since your wife has also rejoined the Audi family.)The moral of the story:  if you can't or don't want to ""afford"" the S4 (or whatever your passion inducing car is), of all of the remaining choices, you will have to give up less if you get the TL SH-AWD Advance than any other car on the ELLPS list -- and you will surely pay less (comparably equipped).DILYL"

Hopefully I will be the beneficiary of Audis new Consumer Reports reliability rating of #4 most reliable car and #1 most reliable European car.BTW, the Volvo S60 T6 Type-R is in the MSRP range of the above noted Acura TL SH-AWD Advance.  HOWEVER, where Acura will discount the poop out of the TL, Volvo will give perhaps 3 or 4% off (if it is at the end of the month).  The trouble with Volvo is they never seem to have any car in stock that pulls it all together.But wait -- the Volvo European delivery program is one of the best of any manufacturer -- get the DVD that 'splains it.  That might make paying closer to sticker a bit more palatable; and if you get the T6 Type-R Polestar Edition, you can drive the thing on the autobahn if you stay a couple of extra days, then turn it back in at one of the drop off points and fly business class back to the states!If you've ever driven a fine European car on the autobahn, you know what I mean when I say it should be on everyone (who loves cars) bucket list.DILYL"

2541,dino001,"October 23, 2013 5:28AM","I experienced first real failure in my now 2-year old 328 wagon.  It was the liftgate latch assembly.  One nice morning the car is showing ""gate open"" warning, so I got out, closed it again.  The warning is still on, so I try again and again.  No avail.  What's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog SUVs) would not open.  As it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window.  I'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module.  Sign of times and designs - 10 cent capacitor or resistor fails on a small circuit board and you get full-blown $500 repair.Nothing is simple today - it used to be, you shut the door, spring latch engaged mechanically.  Today when I close my car (without locking, just shut the last door or hatch), I can often hear several motors engaging for one-two seconds.  This of course means those are candidades for parts that could fail sooner than later. I can only hope it's not a start of all other electronic/electrical components going.  Will see - if I get one of those every two years, I'd be allright.  On the other hand, if I have to visit dealerships more frequently from now for those kinds of problems, I'll have to think about what's next.  The electronics are wonderful inventions that made our lifes easier in many places, but it seems we are now relying on them in so many places for sometimes inexplicable reasons.  Simple door latch is now some electronic module with motor and circuitry attached.  All of that has lifespan much more limited than those traditional locks and we all pay for it sooner or later.  What's worse, the repair people are not handy enough to change those 10 cent parts (that actually failed), they make buy entire assembly costing hundreds - and you can't do anything about it, as when those electronic controls fail, they can't be simply overriden by a switch.  Depending what it is, the machine can get completely disabled or you can get locked out, or you get those annoying warnings on a dashboard lighting like a Xmas tree.OK, rant over.

I'm not sure how many take place later as it seems so many of them are leased and you don't hear much from the people that buy them used.    Makes one wonder if actually kept past warranty?  I realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money.  I had a 10 year old Infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced.  I currently have a 10 year old Toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced.  We also have a 6 year old with Mazda that has never had  a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles.  However, I just replaced a halogen headlight last week on the Mazda for a grand total of $8.99 and about 10 minutes of my labor.I just had my first service(oil change/rotation) on my new Acura and it is the first time I've been back to the dealer in a year except for a class on how to use all the tech stuff.    I have to wonder if it's just the lack of quality of the motors, latches and switches that the German brands use versus the Japanese brands.  I would find it hard to believe that it could be attributable to the actual manufacturing process in the German plants as I've spent quite a bit of time in Germany and know how exact they can be.  I also wonder if the the U.S. made BMWs use different suppliers for those items(I assume they probably do) and if there are substantially less problems in those areas on the U.s. made vs. the German made vehicles.  Just curious I guess.  Based on all the reports(not just in this forum) of electrical bugaboos in the German brands it seems they could do a better job of sourcing parts if a $20k midsize Japanese brand car can have better electrical parts than a $50k ELLPS.  I read something once that blamed many of these electrical gremlins on cheap Eastern Euro electrical parts that VW was sourcing but really can't substantiate that.I realize there are trade offs in life but it sure would be a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] to have go the dealer so often to get little things like that taken care of."

Last night I didn't hit much traffic at all, but had to stop & put gas in the loaner, then stop to put gas in my car on the way home.I don't plan on buying the car at the end of the lease, so I'm not so nuts about it.

It didn't have leather, nor the ""fancy"" diamond grill you see in the TV ads (it's an option).They wanted me to do a test drive.  I declined.  For nearly $40K, I think I'll pass.  You can get a nice A4 for that money....or, an ATS....or a 320i...all of which I think are nicer vehicles. Heck...you can get a loaded up Acura ILX for less than that.

2561,markcincinnati,"October 26, 2013 5:17AM","Quick take: 2014 S4 S-Tronic (333 HP 325 lb ft).There must be some reason that Audi would understate the power of one (or more for all I know) of their engines.  Maybe it is a tax thing in Germany.  Whatever the reason, it seems to me that there is no way this car has only 333 HP and 325 lb ft.I had heard that the 2.0T's power as it stands in the current A6 is understated (and I have driven the car and it does seem impossible that it is 220 HP motivating a car that big) and I read a test report of the S8 that wagged its finger at Audi for understating that engine, too, so I guess it must be an Audi practice to under-rate their engines.Of course, other than for tax reasons (if that really is true), why would they do this?  I recall that Acura (and others) had to restate the power of the RL's 3.7L V6 (to less than 300 HP), suggesting to me that most car companies would probably like to find a way to overstate the power numbers (HP measured at sea level on a cold day, for instance).In any case, even with less than 1,000 miles on it, the S4 seems to have great, surprising, reserves of power -- perhaps sports car power.  An RS version must be dangerous, if this S version is any indication.Once again, I find myself wondering why the recent spate of car magazine sport sedan comparos doesn't include this car!?"

Also the may be justifying it by testing RWD performance sedans, maybe they will do an AWD test later ( not saying it is right, but might be their thinking).

Back 7 years ago, I think only BMW was doing ED and there were packages to drive through Switzerland and down into Italy, Lake Como to be specific.The savings, with FOB originating in Munich, could result in a lease that saved you enough to pay for the trip to Germany (maybe not to tour around Europe though).I see now that Mercedes and Audi are offering ED again.So do these and the BMW ED programs still offer substantial savings on leases?I still won't drive that much so I don't need a lot of miles per year but I'd at least start off with a good tour in Europe."

BMW changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12K miles/12 months, from previously 16K miles/12 months.  This means they either had too much resistance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue).  What about existing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule?  I'm not very happy.  Seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated.  The only consolation I can think of is that my commute is at least 75%  highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current BMW lineup is all turbocharged.  From my previous turbo owning times (had two Subarus with such engines), I know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin).  I may be OK long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think BMW was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods.I'm going to call my dealer to ask about this.

2572,dino001,"October 17, 2013 9:12AM","Not to pick on your word choice, but I would call German car schedule ""aggressive"" and Infiniti's ""extremely conservative"".  Now to answer your question:  Infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines.  For those not to sludge, I suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often.  I guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent.  I feel that if Infiniti suddenly changed the schedule to once per year good quality synthetic, the dealers would lose all those revenue upsell opportunities."
2573,dino001,"October 17, 2013 12:29PM","Whoa!  Now you're picking on my words.  OK, here it is: my choice of words was very careful to precisely express that I do not have a real knowledge, just conjecture and constructed narrative.  However, I should have not written that's ""to answer your question"", but rather ""to speculate"" or something like that.Now, on notion of ""aggressive"" vs. ""conservative"": I wrote that because it is well established in many different professional communities across the board (engineering, finances, accounting, etc.) that ""aggressive"" is usually associated with pushing the envelope of established limits, or even going beyond them. ""Conservative""  is used for practice that is well inside of such limits.  In those terms, Infiniti's schedule does not push any limits, it's well within established limits of that community, from Jiffy Lube to Bob's Chevy, driving 3K/3M schedule ad naseam.  On the other hand, BMW's schedule pushes the envelope, thus would be called aggressive."

Of course, engines are pretty complex, that operate at extreme temps, both cold and hot, dirty, greasy, dusty, etc.  So, something can always go wrong.  My guess is, the oil change intervals will not be the culprit, though.Kirstie....you have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" about you today!"
2576,dino001,"October 18, 2013 6:57AM","when I took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought I was nuts.Interesting that Volvo tech would tell you that.  Perhaps it was a real tech, not the salesman.  My friendly BMW ""advisor"" would sell me $600 of services at our first meeting (1 yr, car had 15K), if I only bought them, that's of course on top of that ""free"" maintenance that they are so eager to advertise when they want to sell you the car.  Best part, which I really loved (NOT), he printed out a sheet with those three bargain priced ($200 each) services with statement like ""customer requests x service"".  Wow, there is no shame in this world.  No, customer does NOT request x service.BTW, those ""recommendations"" were so ridiculous (power steering fluid change and injector cleaning - at 15,000 miles!) that even he didn't have much of a conviction to selling them.  He moved immediately into ""from those three you really need only this one"", which was a bargain-priced alignment at $200.  I told him, well, as much as I actually may agree with you on this one, I won't do it at your price.  Got one done at $125 by a specialised independent garage.  In the process I learned that BMW's alignment is not so easy - tire stores, so eager to sell you one, usually at aroun $70-$80, wouldn't even touch my car.  Something to do with electronics.  So I'm not surprised the dealer wants $200.  If there is no big competition, why not charge arm an leg.So kudos to your Volvo guy that he did not jump on the revenue opportunity, but told you what he really thought."
2577,dino001,"October 18, 2013 7:29AM","I agree, but there is another side of this.  It is much easier to get a warranty honored in the US than in Europe, not just with cars, anything manufactured.  The manufacturers find many inventive ways to walk away from their obligations with impunity over there.  I found there is also much more goodwill here as well (major repairs after warranty with manufacturer's cost participation).  One can say the goodwill is ""prepaid"" in those short intervals."

I wonder how the oil sensor gizmo on the current BMW turbos schedules it?If one throttles a turbo engine regularly, then I could see the need for more frequent oil changes.  But in normal everyday driving, the turbo isn't put under much stress, generates less heat and thus doesn't break down the oil."

2580,alltorque,"October 19, 2013 10:06AM","Read my above post ref Volvo S60 turbodiesel oil changes. Whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to USA, at least in volume terms, they have been around in Europe and Japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. Oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. Of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. After a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal.To take advantage of their tax laws, Japanese manufacturers have used 660 - 695cc turbo gasoline engines, (yes, 0.7 litre), that are real screamers and some have made it to Europe in more mainstream cars.Here in Europe, VW Group have been selling the VW Polo GTi and Skoda Fabia vRS small hatchbacks that have their 1.4 TSI engine which is both turbo- and super-charged to give 170bhp and 250Nm, mated to a 7-spd DSG 'box. Fun little devices. Despite being reasonably highly rated, these engines have official oil change intervals of 1 year or 15,000 miles.........same as the overall service schedule.  You have to use the correct spec oil, though.  But let's be fair, lube oil is the cheapest component in the car; and one of the most important. To be fair, there were reported software problems with some of the early engines which could cause misfires and potential piston damage but AFAIK that is no longer an issue.So, there is no reason that turbo- engines should be saddled with lower oil change intervals - the experience already exists over many years. Unless, of course, it's driven by dealer financial considerations."

The A4 needs to be offered with the 3.0T engine as it is offered in the Q5 3.0T.  Also, for some price, the DSG transmission ought to be offered on the 2.0T, the milder 3.0T and the wilder 3.0T (as it is already there).Were Audi to offer the 8-speed tip and the 7-speed DSG across the board (of three engines), I would look forward to win after win after win for these sport ,sedans: the A4, the AS4 and the S4.  Nice as the new IS 350 F Sport is, I would expect the AS4 and with absolute certainly the S4 to be seeing the IS's LED's in its rearview mirror.And, for the money -- in this league -- the S4 and the 335 would be competitive (with each other, at least).  Of course the IS and even the ATS can certainly be considered the value leaders; yet, the Q50/S is already so highly subvented (and it is likely to remain thus until its issues are behind it) that even with its faults is an attractive alternative for those who want an upscale high content premium car.A friend of mine used to say Audi's are for the left-brainers and BMW's are for the right-brainers -- meaning that ""programmers"" drove Audis and the Vice-president of Sales drove BMWs. I think now the Q50 has become the ""programmers"" [geek squad] car and, well, these days ""everyone wants to be Audi.""Treat yourself -- take a nice long test drive in a 2014 S4 with the DSG transmission -- you may be worthy.

Those people wouldn't know if the car is FWD, RWD, AWD, propelled by jet engine, or rotor in the back.  BTW, not to know Mercedes, same applies to majority of 3-series buyers, or any other car/truck/brand.   Probably 25% of population understands the difference and 5% actually cares.The rest knows the engine, because it makes the noise while driving, but transmission is already a word they heard, but have no clue what it does.  Front- or rear wheel drive... Something to do with food drive we have every year for the poor?  Or if their mind is dirty, then perhaps libido?"

Here in MA, there is a biking event called the Pan Mass Challenge which raises money for the Jimmy Fund at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  It's a two day 110 mile ride and one must raise or commit to paying $4300 to participate - it goes to $5000 if you register late (there are shorter rides with lower fund raising commitments).  They were the first charity event to have participants give them a credit card at registration.  The founder isn't shy about it - trying to raise the amount isn't good enough.Yet they get 5000 people regularly and have a goal of $38 million this year.Part of having a minimum amount is to make sure participants are committed.  It's a logistical nightmare to coordinate support for 5000 people over 110 miles.  If people sign up and then drop out, they have too many resources.  If too many people raise too little money, then the event might not make money."

The thing is the Q50 is still in the league that it is being compared with (and losing.)I drove it (the Q), and yes I liked the IS more, but for a $120/month differential for 36 months with no money down, the Q50 could prove to be a good seller, good value, and selling well enough to allow the '15 or '16 to work out some of the complaints presented by the pros and amateurs (like us).In any case, as I have said previously, Johan has his work cut out for him.  Better tackle the M sooner rather than later, too.  Of course only changing the name of the FX to QX70 seems a invite a sales slow-down there, too.Of course, all of the above would seem to bode for increasingly more expensive IS prices.Sheesh.Drive it like you live."

FWIW here in Phoenix, you can lease a 2013 Q37 for $245/m for 36 months, with $2799 down and $399/m for a Q50 with the same down.

The only options available are the Premium Pkg (Leather, Moonroof, Bose) and Navigation Package.With the G37 filling the low-mid-30k range, I'm willing to bet that finding a Q50 for less than $40k will be virtually impossible!  They'lll market the Q50 as  as a step (or half-step) above the G37...Meanwhile, with the revised pricing, the 2014 G37 is a heck of a value despite being one of the oldest designs in the segment."

Any value to go along or just a broad swipe with no real point?I don't see Inifiniti given the market cachet of BMW, Audi, or MB. If the market thought they were as good they could be as high priced. Companies don't leave cash on the table for altruistic reasons.Infiniti is sort of like the sport version of Lexus. Lexus is a boring reliable luxury make (although trying to break into sport). Infiniti is a reliable sporty make trying to get to where the leaders are. The G series is a bargain if you like pure sport almost as good as BMW but growlier engines and interiors not as nice as MB or Audi. They're sort of like the promising upstart teenager with loads of potential, but not all that refined yet.I also haven't heard hardly any advertising about the new model, perhaps I'm not looking in the right place, lol."

In fact I've had such good luck that I recently bought a '01 BMW 330Ci Cabrio which is also giving me great service.-IMO a 3-4 y/o car hits the sweet spot in the depreciation curve and most haven't got many miles on and so are good for many more.  There are exceptions (like my 11 y/o 330ciC).-Do your homework, check the car out thoroughly including PPI and you should do fine.-As for extended warranties those are a crap shoot.

2650,tifighter,"September 24, 2013 10:35AM","We are just finishing a new website at my company. Originally marketing was saying they thought it would be ready in March. Not live yet, so its a typical website rollout."
2651,markcincinnati,"September 24, 2013 11:50AM","Although I had read the R&T comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (Monday 9/23) -- and I re-read the Q50 v ATS v 335 v IS 350 F-Sport article.  I assume you could infer that I am carrying Infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car.""For those of you who think the Q50 isn't really an upgrade of the G37 -- and assuming you haven't seen one in person, or haven't gotten behind the wheel and haven't driven it -- the Q50 has a seriously upscale (non-Nissan) interior, an exterior that advances the theme (even if you don't like it or aren't drawn to it, it does show more than just a slightly evolutionary change).Yes the engine of the new Q50 is the same as the outgoing engine (and transmission); but, somehow the Q50 at full cry compared with the G37 under similar circumstances, sounds and feels several steps more refined, less harsh, less ""thrashy.""All the tech stuff -- that seems to be universally dissed -- is part of a package that you need not order.  Unfortunately, all the apparently loathed tech: self-driving, pseudo-psychic stuff has to be selected (and endured) to get blind spot monitoring.A nice long test drive in a new Q50S/AWD reveals it to be a major update in luxury and performance.  Your decision to consider these updates as improvements is, well, YOUR decision.I had thought, at MSRP, the Q50 could possibly be the new winna and champeen sports sedan -- when compared to the 4-cylinder Audi A4, BMW 3 series and Cadillac ATS.  I can now count at least five (5) negative articles (3 of them comparison articles) about the new Q50 in ""major"" car enthusiasts' magazines.  One negative, no problem, two negatives, ""I can explain,"" but five articles that deride the lack of a solid steering column or reveal the Q50 to come in fourth (out of four) or second (out of two) and so on, are gonna require some heavy 'splainin' or some major sub-venting whilst Infiniti's designers and engineers apply numerous PTF's, service packs and point-releases in an effort to shore up the car's shortcomings and earn it the right to ask for a ""re-do"" review and comparison.I wouldn't be shocked if an all tricked out Q50S/AWD is offered thusly: Buy one, get one free!Well, OK, maybe that is unlikely.Meanwhile, holy cow, Car and Driver and Road and Track BOTH proclaim an IS 350 the winna and champeen over a BMW 335! And, comparably equipped the 335 is likely to cost five-figures more than the IS.  Get your IS while they're hot!Perhaps, however, the Cadillac ATS is an even more significant ""loser"" as it keeps coming up short despite a best ever chassis.I thought it was particularly damning that the R&T article commented that the 3.6L six in the ATS was the same engine (virtually if not quite literally) as is used to motivate the new Impala.The American and Japanese mfgrs, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus, need to bring out either super or turbo charged 4's and 6's -- ASAP! Frankly, I was damn near stunned that the 335's engine couldn't seal the deal -- proclaiming the Lexus engine as the second best engine was impressive considering its age.Test driving note:Until last Thursday, the Audi A7 3.0T was one of the best (if not the best) cars I have ever driven.  The supercharged engine coupled with that 8-speed transmission coupled with the feel of the car at high speeds coupled with the way it took corners all came together in a car that was attainable without robbing a bank.Last Thursday, my Audi dealer called to offer me a test drive of a new 2014 S4 with the 7-speed DSG transmission.  The S4 tester had the upgraded leather seats, the ""pin-stripe"" black wood trim, B&O sound system and an Audi Exclusive blue pearl paint (at a breathtaking price), to name other ""available"" options.  It was just south of $59,000 (less than an A7 by far.)Again, with the qualification that this car is ""attainable"" by mere mortals (if they are upper-middle class, that is), I would say the S4 is sublime, the best ever I have ever . . . .  :surprise:The transmission is practically telepathic or perhaps to put a finer point on it, the transmission is a mind-reader.  Holy cow, please (who ever I can plead my case to) make this 7-speed DSG transmission an option on EVERYTHING you build.As it is very easy to get a BMW 335 to the ""upper fifties"" and as the current trend seems to be to compare the 335 to the ATS, the Q50 and of course the IS, it would seem a five-way comparison wherein an S4 was included (perhaps without the high-zoot leather and big-buck paint job and the most expensive dash trim) would be a no brainer.  After all, an S4 can be easily configured -- and desirable -- and still be in the lower fifties.It wouldn't surprise me if the S4 bettered both the 335 and the IS 350.As Cheech and Chong once said, ""I saw god, man!""The S4 -- with the MSRP qualification -- is currently my favorite car (of any car that I and other mere mortals could afford).We're, er, I'm not worthy.DILYL."

People are lining up to buy this ""sports sedan"" probably for reasons why the same people didn't buy them before - it's big, comfy, easy to drive.  But it's a BMW, so it must be sporty, right?  Since they've never sit in a true sporty car, if they had, they thought it was uncomfortable crap, how would they know the difference, anyway.Looks to me BMW cashed the chips and they bought huge sale boost.  It will be interesting to see long term effects of this.  VW made a similar gambit with Jetta and Passat by decontenting them, stripping all those good suspension components and making barges out of them.  It worked until it stopped.  After couple of years of initial huge boost they hit a wall and sales stalled, even fell at some point.  I wonder if same could happen to BMW.  Maybe not, who knows.  One thing is certain, my not liking (hating actually) the new 3 steering doesn't matter."
2657,dino001,"September 8, 2013 7:36PM","Exactly, it is all relative.  All they have to do is convince enough people it's better than the alternative.  The funny thing is their competitors are moving toward that point from the other side, making it very crowded market with small differences.   I guess that's inevitable in world of mass production, one has to cater to least objectionable rather than try to stand out.  It's the price for going from niche to global."

Does it still exhibit the same characteristics, such as the overly intrusive boy-racer exhaust note, for example? (Some like it, some do not.)"
2661,m6user,"September 9, 2013 1:23PM","Maybe the reason the Q50 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all.   There's a review of the Q50 over on Left Lane News that is pretty positive in regards to the ""roar"" being a little tamer maybe due to sound proofing more than anything.  The quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit.  But in that comparo you referenced, they could have at least thrown in a G37x just for comparison purposes but maybe they figured they have done that show before."

They figure people that just have to have a fully loaded model with all the bells and whistles won't mind that it could nearly double the price of the car.

Hence, we do tend to test drive, as noted at least 10 times per year. I completely understand if you are NOT in the market, not wanting to test drive.  Conversely, as an ""enthusiast"" I would understand if someone test drove -- on the pro-am circuit -- 24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak.Posting here (and on Audiworld, for instance) gets our (my) interest up, so I am in the camp that favors staying ""on the hunt.""

The AWD factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest BMW store's sales manager told me ""well over 50%"" of the cars they sell are X-driveRegarding BSM, it seems like so many brands offer Blind Spot Monitoring systems as a stand alone option (usually around $500-$600) -- Infiniti bundles it an a $3,000+ package of electronic nannies.  Much as I like the Q50S AWD, I wouldn't get any new car without Blind Spot Monitoring, and I don't want my new car -- yet, if ever -- to be able to drive itself and fight me whenever I try.So, the Q50S AWD is [probably] off the table -- but I can be bought.The Lexus IS offers BSM for relatively cheap (like Audi and Volvo, to name two) -- so score another point for the IS (but the Audi offers it stand alone too, don't you know).The IS 350 F Sport I drove was RWD -- the only one in Cincinnati (the only F Sport so they claim).  I have already signed up to test the first AWD version of an IS 350 F Sport once they come in.  I didn't even bother to get into a regular IS 350 AWD -- although IS's overall seem plentiful (it's just the F Sports that are in short supply -- which was blamed on the dealer's procurement mgr; he/they didn't think Lexus customers would clamor for the SPORT version of anything -- being that it is Lexus -- ""a sofa on wheels"" -- after all).There's a new sheriff in town -- and his/her badge has a stylized ""L"" on it (look out BMW).Drive it like you live."
2671,andres3,"September 12, 2013 11:18AM","I found the IS 350 RWD F-Sport I drove to be a bit more cramped inside than an A4/S4.  Both less leg room, less width, and a lower roof line.  Roof line matters to me a lot, I'm 6'3"" tall, and I'm not skinny anymore.Granted, it was close, but it seemed the S4 was just a notch roomier in every way.I didn't notice much if any difference when switching between Sport, Sport + and comfort/regular.  I did notice a bigger difference in a pre-owned 2011 S4 when I was playing with comfort vs. dynamic.I have to admit I preferred the steering weight and feeling in the '11 S4 and '09 335i I test drove over the '13 S4, which still felt better and more weighted than all others.  I guess in recent years everyone has gone with electric steering for efficiency.  It didn't change the mileage rating on the S4 so it must be .4 miles or less better per gallon."

At low interest rates, $1000 in price translates into around $20 per months on a 60 month loan and can be even less on a lease, especially if it is subsidized by inflated residual. I can hear that salesman saying ""you have 20 bucks, don't you?Nothing helped the manufacturers increase the prices more than captive financing.  Those subsidies partially offset the effective price increases (overall cost of car probably did not go as much up as the stickers if we compare it with loans prior interest rate bubble of 2000s), but create a dangerous situation when the rates go up (ad they will). We will be stuck with much higher prices then."

I've rented plenty of VWs when I travel.  I can see there are more premium bits in the Audi than there are in the  VW.  I also see the things that are the same.Personally, I'll never again take for granted what the Japanese Premium Brands excel in....that is reliability, longevity, brick like build quality.  Those things do indeed matter....a lot.Of course this little diatribe comes hot on the heels of picking up my allegedly repaired S4 this a.m at 7:30 a.m.  There was a littany of things the dealer did.  None of them fixed the problem (as I learned when I got half way home), and now they've introduced some squeaks and rattles into my console area (supposedly caused by removing and replacing the MMI).

As much as my finances are thanking me a bit for having 3 months to prepare for this HUGE purchase (for my budget, was definitely stretching; but pre-owned S4's seem to be holding their value REALLY well, are popular fast sellers making them rare, and I didn't see the value in a lightly used one if it was going to cost nearly as much if not the same amount (given the usual 60K MSRP they are typically bought at).If I'm going to spend a large amount of money, Audi or anyone else better believe I'm going to be picky what my money goes towards; so a custom order seemed like the only option to me.  Thankfully, Audi still makes enough options stand-alone that you can get it just right!  Acura groups too much junk together.I will admit however, even with the Pro's of having 3 months longer with an old ""cheap"" car to shore up the finances, the con's are I'm anxious and can't wait to get my hands on the new S4!  I can see why people without strong will power or color preference just have to have something right now, today!  Turns out Escondido dealer only needed $1K down (SD Audi wanted $2,500 down), I emailed my offer to SD Audi, and about 22.5 hours later, without a response, I decided to extend same offer to Escondido Audi in person, and they jumped for it (after a couple of attempts to get me to go up).I feel just a tad bit bad as the sale-person that helped me previously at SD Audi said they were with clients all day long and just didn't get to my e-mail until after 5.  I had assumed and figured the sales manager was mulling/balking over my offer for too long.  Probably in hind sight I should have called to make the offer and/or confirm she got the email.

Carmax lowered the price on it to make up for the bad tire selection I see... tempting... ..It had a heavy effort filled steering similar to the '11 S4 I test drove, which I liked on both.  I have to admit, I preferred the higher effort steering in the older S4 to the '13 S4 I test drove (not a deal breaker though; just a preference).  In 2013 they went electromechanical steering supposedly for efficiency.  Since the gas mileage didn't change, I can only assume it made a .5 MPG impact or less and rounding variance didn't help them.I have a thing for nice steering wheels.  As much as I loved the old steering wheel in the Audi's, the new '13/'14 version is even nicer!  I didn't think Audi could top the previous version, but they did!"

About 2K below TMV, not sure if that would have flied?As the most recent cross shopper of the TL-SH AWD vs. S4 here on this board and forum, I can say that I couldn't justify a full $15K delta, but close to it seemed rational to me.

2704,dino001,"August 24, 2013 4:56AM","I think the ""is"" is available on coupe only because it is old E90 platform.  It used to be available on sedan as well, but they switched the platforms.  New 4-series won't have ""is"" trim just yet, either.The ""is"" trim is usually a mid-cycle refresh gimmick to maintain sales and buzz on models that are no longer ""all new"", to keep them running.  IIRC, it wasn't available on the new platform with 330i right away, either.  Then when they brought the turbo six engine (335i), it wasn't there either until some time has passed.  If the patterns were to repeat, we should see (hopefully) some ""is"" trims available on the new F30 platform, as the novelty wears off.  It (the novelty) already has passed for sedans, but you still have brand new wagon, GT, 328 diesel, 320, the 4-series coupe coming just in 2013, /2014 season.  The convertible is next, I'm sure.  Once the entire lineup is complete, the sedan will come with a refreshed look, as it always does and some additional stuff, to keep the interest and push early lessee adopters from 2012 to getting into 2015/16.  I think that would be a perfect time for them to introduce the ""is"" trim on F3x lineup.All manufacturers try to spoonfeed their new stuff, so there is always something to talk about.  BMW actually brought a lot of new models this year, so they'll wait with incremental improvements until they see buzz dying off."

But, I really don't buy into a dealership treating you better if you buy the car from them.  Warranty work is paid the same regardless.  And, let's face it, service work has a whole lot more margin than new car sales.I think the training, the time spent understanding the cars, the amount of time spent daily focused on customer service (or lack thereof) becomes evident in the way they take care of your problems.Your Acura dealership experience would have prompted me to send a strongly worded letter to Acura corporate.

This leaves 328 for buyers who like those options, like better seats (Sport/M-Sport) and/or interior inlays (Lux) and are able/not mind paying.

The MB-Tex, or whatever it is called is a nice fake leather, so dealers order majority of those C250 and even C300, or C350 with those seats.  At least in case of 328 and 335, majority get premium package, which has leather.  Kind of sad.  I'm hoping that when the novelty wears off, which should be soon enough, in couple of years they'll start adding leather as one of those ""no cost options"", or at some lower price, call it ""value package"", or similar.  Something like that seems to be going on already in other areas, most cars get ""build credit"", which I'm not sure what it means, but smells to me like a simple cash rebate."

People NOW expect leather, Nav, moonroofs, and all the elec gadgets in ""ELSP"" cars.  I wish BMW would drop the ""L"" in the ELSP and make their 320i a Entry Level Sport Sedan, drop the Premium package and add a true M sport package, with the E90 steering feel, have it with a manual or Auto. Forget Nav too.  But we all know BMW wont do it and people in their forum know that BMW wont do it. It seems people aren't willing to except the fact that the BMW that we all knew isn't the BMW of today.What I find interesting is, people are comparing their BMW's that they built to a 328i that the dealer ordered as a loaner, can't compare apples and oranges."

My biggetst beef with the so called average buyer is that they look at 3 series or some other sports sedan and complain it's too small in the back seat, or suspension is too hard, or steering too heavy, to which the company responds by turning it into a Buick.

Plus, at least up until now, the Germans have been able to get what they're charging for ""premium"" cars with lots of options.I've liked the BMWs I've owned.  I like the Audi I now have.  I will say, it's been a long time since I've had a car as troublesome as the Audi, though.The fact that BMW is really going in a direction where the price is going up, but the performance and the quality of the materials (i.e. letherette vs leather) is going down, makes me want to look elsewhere for my next vehicle in 18-24 months.I think the real value in the Lexus, Acura, etc, with their reliability, high quality, is becoming more apparent to me, as well as more appealing....expecially at their price points."

BMW, like most manufacturers, are trying to expand the size of their clientele. For BMW (and MB and Audi), the only direction they can go, socio-economically, is down.

A tremendously great bargain and I'm actually surprised they said yes so quickly to the deal.  Every S4 you find at the dealer is optioned up to the gills from $55K to $61K MSRP which makes them very expensive (go with less options, more car).  Never understood features or gadgets causing someone to get an ultra optioned up A4 over a less optioned up S4 at similar prices.If all you want is features and gadgets, why not just get a Korean car?   MMI is nearly $4K after taxes, why not just mount a laptop or IPAD in the car for 1/4 the cost?  The options are definitely where they are making their money and profit.

But, the chasis and drivetrain are the same.  The interior is the same.  The features/options are the same.  Yet, I haven't seen one S5 (of the few new ones I've seen) with an MSRP under $60K.Funny thing about the 335i.  You'd be hard pressed to find much of a selection of them, anywhere you look.  I don't know why either.  Yes, it can be optioned up to $60K (which puts it on par, options-wise, to a $55K S4).  A stripper 335i, if you could find one, might be available for $45K.  But, good luck finding one of those.To me, just the mere fact that the 335i has a much sweeter 6 cyl than the 4 cyl in the F30s might be worth the price delta.

It also had Mazda's BSM (Blind Spot Monitoring) system standard, but the very concept seemed ridiculous to me.  I expected to deactivate it and never give it another thought.I've always believed that blind spots could be eliminated with properly adjusted mirrors, which was true based on all the cars I've owned in the past.  But the CX-9 is a much larger vehicle that it looks, being classified as a Full-Size or Large Crossover/CUV.  Even now, it simply doesn't look that big to me and it feels more like a sporty mid-size sedan behind the wheel than any other SUV I've ever driven.Even with my mirrors perfectly adjusted (which so few drivers ever learn to do), there is a blind spot on both sides at the rear corners!  I'm not sure exactly how other systems work, but on the Mazda there are cameras mounted under the rear bumper at both corners.  When a vehicle enters the space that a camera is monitoring, a yellow warning light (little picture of one car driving into the side of another with a big X over it) appears on the side mirror on that side of the car.  If the turn signal is activated indicating a lane change and a vehicle is in the 'blind spot', the audio system mutes and a series of warning beeps alerts the driver.It actually works very well, although I still think a quick half-turn of the head to use my peripheral vision to make sure the lane is clear is important!  Mazda has expanded the functionality of the system in some 2014 models to include Rear Cross Traffic Alert.  RCTA uses the same cameras as BSM to scan for vehicles moving toward you as you back out of a parking space.I am a very alert and focused driver.  Instead of focusing on the car in front of me, I am always scanning further ahead so I can be ready to brake, maneuver or accelerate instantly if I need to.  Even when I have no need to change lanes, I love the fact that I always know if a vehicle is flanking me on either side.  For example, you're driving on a 3-lane expressway and suddenly a delivery truck drops a refrigerator right into yoru lane and you have barely a second to react.  Knowing which side of your car was clear for your to swerve into that lane could be life-saving information!While I find BSM to be useful, some of the latest 'safety' features available are over-the-top and seem like addded complexity just so they can add more acronyms to the car's features!  The new 2014 Mazda6 has a Forward Obstruction Warning System that ""detects obstructions ahead and warns you of a possible collision.""  My car already has this- it's called a windshield, you look through it and if you see something in your path, you press the brake and/or steer around it.There's also Mazda's Radar Cruise Control that monitors the distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you and adjusts speed up to a driver-set limit or down to maintain a safe following distance.  Um, if I'm using cruise control then I'm on an interstae with two or more lanes.  If a car ahead of me slows down, I don't want to slow down with them, I will go around them!My mom was shopping for a new car earlier this year and the Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima and Volvo S60 were on her short list.  We went to the Volvo dealer near my house and started walking the lot so she could see some different inteiror colors, available wheel designs and other features that can be difficult to decipher by looking at a brochure.I have a rather dark sense of humor at times and I consider sarcasm (or smart@ss as my nana called it) my second language.   My mom has a great sense of humor but she's a lot nicer than me (most of the time) and never rude or sarcastic, but every now and then she'll fire back a retort to a comment I make that surprises the heck out of me (and proves that I've been a bad influence on my own mom, which makes me very proud)!While we were walking around checking out the S60 models they had in stock, we were greeted by a saleman who barely looked old enough to drive a car, much less sell them.  He was obviously very green and instead of screwing with the kid's head, I actually decided to be nice.  He started going over the cars features and one of the first topics was-Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian DetectionThe Full Auto Brake with Pedestrian Detection was the world's first and he went into great detail.  He explained that it was active at speeds up to approximately 25mph and, if it detected a pedestrian ahead, it would alert the driver if there was enough time to apply the brakes, or it would automatically cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically if necessary!I couldn't resist and asked, ""But what if i WANT to hit someone in the road ahead?""Before he could speak, my mom replied instantly- ""Well you'd just need to be going over 25mph.  Under 25mph you'd barely maim them, at best...""**I have never been more proud of my Mom in all of my 39 years!The poor salesman (sales-boy, sales-child?) had a look on his face that I can't convey in words...he excused himself less than a minute later and the Sales Manager came back in his place and we never saw the kid again.....And I was ready to start asking about trunk space and how many cubic feet of space does an average human body occupy...Once we realized that the Sales Manager was completely devoid of any sort of perosnality, we were bored and decided to move on to another Volvo dealer for the test drive.  We both behaved very well right up to the end...when I decided to test the Collision Warning with Full  Auto Brake by driving at constant 20mph directly toward the wall of the service department.  It worked...but apparently the salesman with us felt that I should have warned him before I did it!?  Did I need to tell him before I turned on the stereo, or clicked on the turn signal???  If I'm going to buy a car (or my mom), of course I'm going to test out every feature it has....duh!There are only three Volvo dealers in Metro Atlanta and we decided not to visit the third one sinice we probably won't be welcomed with open arms at the other two!She ended up falling in love with a CPO 2010 Infiniti M35 Sport with 21k miles on it.  My step-dad insisted on going with us to buy it so he could act as a buffer between us...we were on our best behavior...I almost died of boredom.  But the car rocks!"
2758,andres3,"August 15, 2013 10:08PM","Lexus IS 350 report.I drove the regular RWD IS350 and the F-Sport IS 350 (RWD too).Some Background:Several years ago I drove an IS 350 and it had a tremendous engine, it felt very fast and had it all over the TL-S even though the numbers were close, the speed wasn't, Lexus won easy.  That is why I gave the new IS350 some consideration.While a very nice, comfortable, quiet sports sedan, it just feels devoid of soul, with no personality other than being modern and techie.I am feeling nearly 100% positive the 8-speed automatic must be programmed to allow only 70% engine power during the first 1,000 miles (for proper break-in) even during full throttle acceleration, because I felt the car was slow and sluggish, and not giving me the 305 HP I wanted to feel.   I am spoiled by a dual clutch auto, but dang it, I wanted to like the car, but I just didn't.Superb leather, drive, ride, handled pretty good, well put together, but it just didn't feel like a $45K car.  100% made in Japan; that was impressive.There just wasn't all that much difference between regular comfort mode, and sport mode, nor from sport mode, to sport + (only in F-sport trim).  I felt the '11 S4 had much more noticeable difference between comfort and dynamic (more legit and mechanical; less electronic feeling).A Lexus dealer quoted me sticker MSRP on one; is it 2002 again?  What's the point of online quotes if you just reiterate the sticker price?While seemingly significantly sportier than previous Lexus attempts, it still comes off as a softer quieter car.ATS test drive:  Some of the same feelings, though the 3.6 is much more refined and has more punch than the 2.0T.  The interior doesn't do it for me in the ATS though.  There are a few interior parts and pieces that you can tell belong on a 10K car, not a 50K car (moon/sun roof cover is one).  The 2.0T felt like 200 HP since that's what my Audi had stock with its 2.0T.  Maybe Audi underrates, Cadillac overrates, and there you go.  The ATS was a good handler though, but didn't feel fun.  The 3.6 was more fun, and sounded better under hard acceleration.  Changing from TOUR to Sport mode didn't do much.The ATS chassis and suspension was upset and unbalanced by minor imperfections in the roadway.  A 1"" deep 1' diamter circle in the asphalt would be run over in my Audi and ignored, but in the ATS, it felt like the back end came out and I wasn't going fast, nor accelerating hard at the time.  Happened with both ATS' trying both engines."
2759,graphicguy,"August 16, 2013 6:08AM","Andres...thanks for the update.  You and I seem to have the same perceptions.While I haven't driven the '14 IS 350, and I doubt it's on my radar anytime in the foreseeable future, it's good to hear initial impressions.I did test drive an ATS.  The 2.0L is coarse, to say the least, and certainly not remotely as smooth as the Audi 2.0 turbo.  The 3.6L is smoother, but I'm not so certain it performs any better than the 6 cyl.  Like you, I found some of the interior materials to be ""Chevy Cruze"" looking.It did handle well, but also as you point out, the suspension crashes a lot over the slightest road imperfections to  achieve most of its handling abilities (that, and some impressive weight trimming).Again, to me it didn't feel like a mid $40K car.Markincincinnati, I was wondering how the 2.0L in something as big as the A6 would work.  So, you're saying it isn't sluggish?I like the Q5.  And, a Q5 with the S/C 3.0L would be the first vehicle I'd be looking at IF (BIG IF) I were ever in the market for an SUV.BTW, the S4 is over in Beechmont (already tried Montgomery twice) for the 3rd attempt to fix the Quattro ""binding"" issues, and iPod issue resolved.  They put me in another A6 3.0 for the weekend.  Man...is it nice, fast and handles well for a big car. That said, it's also much ""softer"" all the way around coming from the S4."

2761,fedlawman,"August 17, 2013 6:05PM","I test drove a new 320i today. Plain Jane with auto tranny, engine idle-stop, and leather or vinyl - I couldn't tell.Anyways, I was surprised by it's pep - torquier than I expected. Engine was smooth (not straight-six smooth, but Honda I-4 smooth, yes) and turbo lag was very minimal. It isn't a fast car, but it felt quick. Confident power for merging onto freeways and passing at speed. Handling was very nice too - smooth and refined and I didn't really sense any vagueness in the steering (very tight and responsive, but road feel is non-existent). It felt more nimble than other recent 3ers I've driven. Cornering was surprising flat and tenacious at 8/10ths.Overall I think it's without a doubt the nicest Buick I've ever driven. Not outstanding, but very competant. If someone gifted it to me, I'd keep it."
2762,igozoomzoom,"August 18, 2013 12:04PM","I actually had one last year as a rental when I was in Toronto for two weeks.  I always reserve a 'Premium' class vehicle since I travel for 2-3 days per week at least 36 weeks each year.  I'm a Commerical Insurance Premium Auditor and the audit expense is billed to the client as part of the contract.  Part of my contract with the Audit Firm I work for is that I only stay in at Hilton properties (Hampton or Hilton Garden Inn if possible), I fly busines class and whether I'm driving from home to the client of flying somewhere and renting a car, I can rent anthing I choose as long as it is within $25/day of what I would get for mileage reimbursement in my own car.  In reality, I get the Premium cars for a lot less than what I'm allowed!Anyway, I spent two weeks in Toronto last March and my Premium-class rental car was a 2013 BMW 320i.  I've had a 328i here in the U.S. a few times also and, to be honest, the Candian 320i and U.S. 328i look, feel and drive identical 95% of the time.  The only time I perceived any difference was under full-throttle accelration, particularly in passing/merging situations more so than from a stop.Last month, I had to visit a client located about 75 miles west of Los Angelese in the middle of godforsaken nowhere!  When I got to Southern California, I prefer to flying to Orange County and drive another 20-30 miles than deal with LAX!  I coudn't get a flight into Orange this time,  but if I was willing to deal with a plane change in Phoenix that added almost two hours to my trip time, I could fly into Bob Hope instead of LAX.  I decided it was worth it because flying into Bob Hope is like flying into Key West, it's so small and everything is so easy and fast.I was pleasantly surprised that, for the very first time, I had a rental BMW that wasn&#146;t White!  This one was a gorgeous deep blue that I later found out is called Imperial Blue Metallic.  The reason the rentals are usually White is because any color other than Alpine White or Jet Black is Metallic and costs $550 extra.  I was hoping that the $550 paint option might mean it was a heavily optioned model for once.When I was handed the key fob, I realized that it didn&#146;t appear to have the Comfort Access keyless entry, so that dashed any hopes of it having the Premium Package. I opened the door and the Venetian Beige SensaTec (Leatherette) was a pleasant change from the usual Black faux-leather.  After I loaded the trunk and got in the driver&#146;s seat, I started reaching to adjust my seat only find the power seat controls had been moved..and then I finally realized that the seats were 6-way manually adjustable, just like my 2006 Mazda3.and manual driver&#146;s seat didn&#146;t have adjustable lumbar support!  I had never.  Even my 8yr old Mazda has lumbar support!I have been spoiled by most other rental cars and by my 2012 Mazda CX-9 because I hadn&#146;t dealt with manually adjusting a seat trying to find the best position in years!  No one else ever drives the old Mazda3, so the manual seat never moves.I&#146;ll give BMW a little credit for seat design and comfort, because even without the lumbar adjustment or any power adjustments, it was still a comfy driver&#146;s seat.  Thankfully it wasn&#146;t a COLD driver&#146;s seat because it also lacked heated front seats, which the previous 3-seriees I&#146;ve driven included.I found the Window Sticker folded up in the glovebox after I got to my hotel that night.  This was the most strangely optioned vehicle I&#146;ve ran across in years.  I knew something was different about the interior but couldn&#146;t put my finger on it. Then I saw on the Window Sticker that the Dark Burl Walnut Wood trim on the dash was $500 and it replaced the target.  I assumed it that the Dark Walnut was part of the Venetian Beige interior color, but that wasn&#146;t the case.The car had a Power Moonroof which I assumed had become standard on the 3-series until I that Window Sticker.   The car still had one oddball feature for me to discover...Even though it didn&#146;t have the Cold Weather Pkg (Heated seats, alarm system) or the Premium Package (dual power seats, moonroof, Comfort Access key) ; it had  the $900 Lighting Package with the Xenon headlight and Adaptive Light Control!Here&#146;s a recap=$32,550 &#150; Base MSPR550 &#150; Imperial Blue Metallic paint1050 &#150; Moonroof500 &#150; Dark Burl Walnut wood trim900 &#150; Lighting Package (Xenon light and Adaptive Light Control925 &#150; Destination Change$36,475 was the Grand Total.I love the color combination with the deep Imperial Blue outside and Venetian Beige interior; the Silver Matte trim that looks good with the Black interior is also standard with the Beige, but I the darker wood trim looks so much better.  So the overall appearance and coordination of exterior color with interior color and interior trim was very appealing.The lack of Power Front Seats is unacceptable on a car that sticker over $36k!  Dual power front seats with driver&#146;s seat memory are optional for $995 and would be much more useful than the Xenon headlights.The BMW 320i reminds me of another car that I often rented back in 2011-2012- the Infiniti G25.  The G25 was identical to the G37 Sedan in appearance and standard features.  The only difference was the G25 has a 2.5L 218hp V6 in place of the G37&#146;s 3.7L 328hp V6.  The G25 smaller, less powerful engine had the unexpected benefit of being smoother and quieter than the G37&#146;s big V6.  The G25 was also a pleasure to drive, handled very well and even with 110hp less than G37, it never felt underpowered or like it was missing anything.  At least until you got behind the wheel of the G37 and learned what the phrase &#145;stupid-fast&#146; means!  After driving the G37, the G25 wasn&#146;t quite as appealing.Evaluated on its own merits rather than comparing it to other 3-Series models, it is a surprisingly fun car to drive and feels 100% BMW.   But after driving the 328i, comparisons are inevitable and the small price difference may not seem like such a deal???After driving the 320i and even the 328i in the past, the car I rent  most often remains my favorite among entry-level luxury sedans- the Volvo S60 T5!"
2763,fedlawman,"August 18, 2013 8:48PM","I haven't seen one on the road yet either. The white one I drove (with manual seat that I thought was just fine) was at the BMW Drive Event I participated in. The event was poorly run so I only had time for the one drive, but the free BMW travel mug was a nice bit of swag.I still haven't driven the 328i so I have no basis to compare, but based on my drive, I think most people will be perfectly happy with the power of the 320i. It felt lively to me, and was the most BMW-like BMW I have driven in a long time - meaning, it had a fun, playful, lively, zippiness about it, with ideal ride/handling compliance and enough power to be fun without being scary (like my friend's 2010 M5 I drove a couple weeks ago!)."

I could care less if the fix is free and I get a cool loaner.  It would just be too much of a hassle.  I'm sure this may be an extreme case but your experience is the common perception and you know what perception is.......reality.If I want that I'll spend $20k and get a 4yr old G or TL and still only be in the shop a couple of times a year if that.   Hell, my wife's Mazda6 is 6 years old and it has never been in the shop once for repairs.  One thing had to be adjusted and that was done at the first oil change.  Every single other visit has been for normal, routine maint.  So far my new Acura RDX has not been back to the dealer even once in my first 10 months of ownership.  Hasn't even had it's first free oil change yet.  Soon though.  I truly hope the glitches with your car get fixed and you have some relief from trips to the dealer."
2781,andres3,"August 1, 2013 1:38PM","What I've seen from driving TL-SH AWD and looking at the S4 (and knowing it's performance figures).The TL gets what I consider low mileage, the S4 has 10% more power and 10% better gas mileage to boot.  That's probably due to the TL being about 250 lbs. heavier and it is bigger with more leg room, as well as not having a 7th gear like the Audi (nor the efficient dual clutch system).I do think the new TL's are improved in the looks department, but the styling still leaves me thinking ""plain Jane.""  The S4 is a truly beautiful car, and has what appears to me to be a paint job a few notches higher in quality.  The S4 offers some color selection (not much) while the TL offers almost none (White Black, and shades in between, along with an ugly purple they call red).TL Pros:  Bigger, more leg room, more rear seat room.  Reliable.S4's Pros:  better engine, better transmission, better interior, better exterior, better design, better styling (I realize that's subjective), better color selection, lighter/smaller more nimble.Frankly, Edmund's TMV puts the TL at $39,500 with the AWD and Tech package.  I've looked at all the details, and frankly, Acura in my view should have priced it at $37,000.   They did take some shortcuts....For instance, the roof rails are not body colored .Also, the 3.7 from Nissan/Inifiniti have about 330 HP, why not Acura's?The base FWD TL costs $4K more than the Honda Accord V6 and for that you get 2 added HP, 2 less MPG, and a somewhat nicer interior.  Just throwing that in there for anyone considering a FWD TL.As nice as the TL-Tech interior is, the S4's is better.   I compared a base TL-AWD w/ the Tech package, and the tech package has nicer perforated leather than the base model, but the S4's Nappa leather was still clearly superior to both (softer and nicer).  Yes, I know the Nappa isn't standard."

To me, it was totally worth every penny. I feel confident that when I sell the car, I will be able to get the extra $4500 that I paid back in my pocket.I did not look at the S4 due to budget, but I did look at the regular A4. The TL offered the better play based on the Pros you had mentioned. A real steal for $32K"
2783,mrminsky1,"August 1, 2013 7:31PM","The msrp the TL was closer to $9000 higher than the Accord. Have you seen the TL SE with some of the nice extras including the leather, wheels, etc?. So yes to me, the premium was worth it. But this is the same question we have been asking for years.ES350 or Camry (now the Avalon)TL or AccordG37 or Maxima or Altimaand since Audi is in question as well, why not get the VW GLI versus an A4 FW? People like to compare all these vehicles to each other and assume that the mainstream ones drive and feel the same as their luxury counterparts. The Answer is no. I drove the Accord and I though it was a lot of car for the money. However not at the same level of the TL.  I actually liked it and would have been a strong possibility. But when I looked at TL, I really thought I was getting more for the money. The newer SE trim is fantastic.   I liked the looks and the drive. The leather and seats are top notch. The interior was a step above. The 18 inch tires and wheels were a knockout. the spoiler is super cool. Both the suspension  and the driving dynamics are different. So the cars might be very similar in many respects, but the cars are very different. to answer your question, I think I can get the $4500 price difference when the time comes to sell it. If not, hopefully, I will feel that based on what I paid, I got my monies worth.I know looks are very subjective so what looks good to one my not look good to another. I think the newer version of the TL looks great. THe new Accord would have been a fine choice too, but the small Acura premium was worth it to me."
2784,andres3,"August 1, 2013 9:38PM","$32K is a great deal by the way for the Base TL FWD.  What would you figure an equivalent deal is for adding SH-AWD and TECH.  Looks like that would add $7K at least unfortunately from the quotes I'm getting.I'd pay $500 extra for the upgraded perforated Milano leather, and $500 extra for the ELS sound system.

2785,graphicguy,"August 2, 2013 6:37AM","andres3...sounds like you really like the S4.  They're great cars.  Go for it.  I will say that the Audi S/C 3.0 is WAAAAAYY UNDER RATED.  My guess is it puts out closer to 350+ instead of the ~330HP they advertise.I don't have the nappa leather in mine.  I have the leather/synth suede stuff.  It works...no complaints.Really find both the Acura and the Audi to be similar in materials and build, inside and out. Paint?  I have the Ibis White.  No metallic.  The only S4 colors I've seen on the lots are my white, a metallic white (extra cost), black, metallic black (extra cost), a mid-level blue (extra cost).  Audi interiors are black or grey.  Not sure about the TL's colors these days.  I know my sister's is metalic black.  My former TL was something called ""Bellanova white"" (metallic white).  I don't remember paying more for the metallic, but Acura may have changed their tune.  Don't know that I can say the paint job on one or the other is better.  Leather on my sister's TL is pretty darned nice.  Her seats are nicer (comfortable with good bolstering) than the ones in my S4 (hard and highly bolstered).  She has full leather, I don't.  Shifter in the Audi gets red hot in the summer sun (plastic).  TL has a leather shifter....does not get hot.  I do like the steering wheel of my S4 better.  Plus, the S4's dash and console area is prettier.The electronics in the TL are much better than those in the S4 (which has been where most of my warranty work been).  Some MMI issues my dealer still can't figure out.Different cars, different routes, different drivers, but I get about 19 MPG overall in my S4.  My sister says she gets about 22 MPG overall in her TL SH AWD.The 3.7 in the TL SH AWD is down on HP compared to the 3.7 in the INfiniti.  But, the Acura has more torque than the Infiniti.I truly do wish my S4 spent less time at the dealer's shop.  It is a PITA.  But, when it's on the road, it's a true joy to drive.Then again, so is the TL SH AWD.  Bottom line, you can't go wrong with either as long as you go into it with open eyes.Tough call.  Your money.  Do what you want.  Let us know what you land on.BTW....my BMW dealer had a ""drive event"" a couple of weeks ago.  At the S4's price, I'd throw in the 335i xDrive into the mix.  The F30s aren't as good as my previous E92, but they're still good cars. At that $55K price point, you can get a pretty loaded up 335ix.  A Premium Plus S4 with B&O and DSG will hit right about the same price range.  Plus, I believe BMW dealers are more willing to deal than Audi dealers."

2787,tlong,"August 2, 2013 11:09AM","Graphicguy, your experiences mirror my somewhat dated ones.I bought a new '98 A4 2.8 6cyl, stick, sports package brand new. I drove it 6 years and loved the car. I did start having some reliability issues with cooling and the dealer had trouble locating the problem. I had a number of visits out of warranty and spent $1-2K on the car and it still wasn't fully fixed. Reluctantly at 88K miles (much sooner than I usually get rid of a car) in 2005 I replace the A4 with an '05 Acura TL.I'm still driving the Acura and I'm at 133K, with almost zero problems. The Acura is technologically superior to the Audi. The interior features are better although I felt the luxury quality of the Audi interior was superior (but the Acura is still quite good). In driving qualities there was no comparison - the Acura is a nice cruiser; the Audi was a fabulous car to drive stick, much more agile, and it was as smooth as butter.I only wish I could have the Acura levels of reliability in an Audi or other German car. I still like the Acura a lot, but I really miss that Audi. But I don't miss the reliablity issues and dealer costs."
2788,andres3,"August 2, 2013 8:41PM","I do like the S4's looks, styling, and engineering.  Not too many buttons, I did get button overload in the TL SH-AWD and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes.  The Acura just goes nuts with buttons, and comes off as a ""TECHIE"" car to me, whereas the Audi comes off as an Engineer's driver's driver car.However, $55K is out of my budget.  I'm already stretching and blowing the budget if I start at a stripper base model no options S4, which will get close to $55K out the door anyway given CA taxes and DMV fees.Realistically I'm looking at a 2 year old S4 at about $40K vs. the TL-SH-AWD brand new.What year is your S4?The other problem with getting a stripped no options S4 is I would REALLY REALLY Like the Bang & Olufsen sound system upgrade, DSG (no brainer to me), and the rear sport differential.  Those are pretty much must haves (OK, the sounds sytem isn't a must, but highly worth the additional cost and you can get it as a stand alone add-on).  Also, I wish I could get the Nappa Leather as a stand alone low cost upgrade (as I've pointed out it takes the S4's seat/armrest, door lining interior up to another level and you can also get red, brown, or white mixed into your black bolsters), unfortunately, I think it comes packaged only with the Premium Plus or Prestige packages $$$$.This is why a 2011 or 2012 S4 could be in my future rather than the one I looked at, which was a fresh off the boat brand spankin' new 2014 model in a beautiful metallic pearl dark grey.  Maybe because it was spotless and the TL's typically had been sitting for awhile with 100-200 miles on them it made the paint pop better on the Audi.That 2014 S4 had all the upgrades, 19"" wheels, nappa, B&O sound, adaptive suspension, bells and whistles $55K sticker.  Talk about lust.  19"" wheels are highly unnecessary and expensive though each time you buy tires, but they looked great (tri-spoke design).It's a shame your S4's been a dud reliability wise, I'd be angry if that happened to me.  Hopefully, you were just unlucky and most S4's are reliable.If I was going to consider BMW (which has a large share of reliability issues lately it seems), it would be the 335i, saw one at Carmax for about $25K with about 37K miles 2009 sport package.  No need for AWD on a BMW in So Cal.I should probably take a look at Infiniti; I liked their interior design on the G35's last I looked.    I want to try either RWD or AWD for the next car."
2789,andres3,"August 2, 2013 9:15PM","On the S4 I think the lower rear end of the back bumper should be painted body color, but it isn't.  Works better with some colors moreso than others.On the TL the roof seams should really not be big black bars, but either seamless or at least body colored.If my $30K out the door A3 can have seamless roof, why can't TL?Acura misses:  ELS sounds system should be standard in all SH-AWD TL models, as should the better perforated Milano leather.  Tech package should have neither of those features inside it, but it does.Audi misses:  Sport Diff should be standard, metallic paint should be standard, and price should be a tad lower."
2790,graphicguy,"August 3, 2013 8:06AM","Interesting idea to swap with my sister for a couple of weeks.  Not sure she'd go for it.  Not sure I want to.Granted, I don't try, in any way, shape or form to save fuel.  So, maybe 19 MPG is pretty good, given the way I drive.  But, I had an E92 335ix before the Audi.  Same driving style, and got 21 MPG.  We're not talking a big delta looking at those numbers.I've never been in a ""base"" TL.  So, I don't know how those stack up, technology wise.  Without a doubt, for an enthusiast, the SH AWD with Tech Package is the way to go.My sister has the Advance package.  Her leather (Milano?) is very nice.Mine is a '13, that my (then) GF bought when the '13s had hit the streets last spring.  I'm sure the '14s are out by now, but not certain of that.  It's a Premium Plus.  It has the torque vectoring rear (as does the TL SH AWD), DSG, keyless start.  B&O is good.  I don't think it trumps the ELS in the Acura, though.  Plus, dealer still can't seem to get my iPod/iPhone to work consistently with it.It was a ~$55K sticker.  IIRC, purchase price was right around $52K and change....give or take.Still waiting for the part from Germany to get the ""Quattro binding"" issue fixed.  Dealer says it's not hurting anything by driving it.  Sometimes I wonder, given how it shudders.They put me in nice cars to drive while it's in the shop.  Do I still like it?Yeah....it's a great car to drive.  Is it worth the $12K-$15K premium over the TL SH AWD Tech?  I can't make that case. The Acura is really good, too.Will I buy another one?  Probably not.  I'll hold onto this one for another 18-24 mos.  That will take it to near the end of the warranty period.  Based on current experiences, I don't want to own it after the warranty has expired.By then, the new TL will be in the showroom.  I'll give it a serious look."

2798,tlong,"June 25, 2013 9:55PM","Back to the current and near-future of Acura.the demise of the TSX will take a sedan AND wagon out of the lineup. Will the ILX, TLX and RLX sedans and RDX and MDX crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance?Acura needs to fix the appearance of the TL. It doesn't really matter if it performs well and has a nice interior, it is still ugly. I'm driving my '05 TL at 132K miles and I can tell you that I haven't the slightest interest in the new TL. My vintage TL IMHO was one of the nicer looking cars on the road and Acura screwed up big time in going from very handsome to butt ugly (or beak-ugly). Don't underestimate appearance, as few people want to invest that type of money and drive an ugly car.Then there's the TSX - a car that went from sporty and handsome to not-as-ugly-as-the-TL, but bloated and not sharp handling any more. So Acura blew it on two of their top vehicles. That's a pretty sad story for a lineup that was a lot better 7 years ago than today.Then again, Buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (Verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (Regal) and near-full-size sedan (LaCrosse) along with a large Crossover (Enclave) and mini-crossover (Encore). In particular, the Encore is a joke compared to the RDX and the LaCrosse is no RLX. But somehow, Buick is more desirable than Acura to most buyers.Well, I'd say the Buicks are actually at least decent looking to attractive. Like I said, don't underestimate the power of ugly to ruin a brand. Buick is getting a lot better and Acura has gone the other direction. While I would never buy a Buick, I can see why they are improving relative to Acura."

The wheels, the faux quad tail pipes are 2 styling points that really ""make"" the car.Sween - you are right that Acura took too long with the refresh or restyle.When is the TL replacement coming?  2015 MY?  Acura dealers are already ""giving them away"" at below invoice prices.  Who knows what kind of rebates, conquest cash, trunk money, & cheap financing they will throw the TL's way once they decide to ""fire sale"" in the coming months."

Long distance travel, wide roads, long commutes, cheap gas all add up to big incentives for the big engined, big road machines we grew up with.  You're making the same argument I am but in reverse.So many post ""Americans just have to have big HP or big cars"" and the underlying insinuation that it IS some kind of character flaw.  We are all human beings and pretty much reacting to the situation we are in and given the same circumstances most people from anywhere in the world would behave similarly IMO.But I guess there are the ""enlightened"" few that would drive a Prius if gas was less than $1 gal. and I don't think any single country would have a monopoly on them.  LOL.  Of course, if gas had never rose above a $1 a gal would there even be a Prius???"
2819,m6user,"June 16, 2013 10:14AM","No, i think we agree in general and that's pretty much what I'm talking about.....in general and we are talking somewhat historically here.  The scenario regarding gas prices in this country has changed greatly during the past 5 years so going forward a lot of smaller choices are going to made.  There are always exceptions to any rule and different degrees of difference.  But, again and in general, I think Americas love affair with big HP and big cars stemmed from the vast size and open spaces that were available when the auto came into being in this country.  The scenario you describe(narrow roads, congestion, short  travel distances and eventually high fuel prices) for Europe was like that for years and years before the auto made it debut.I think I've only owned one car with over 300 hp but I have owned several V8s and still have a V8 pickup that gets used sparingly while my I4 gets the bulk of the miles.   I think my 68 Mustang V8 was rated at less than 200hp."
2820,dino001,"June 16, 2013 4:04PM","I agree with your previous statement.  Many people often insinuate the Europeans drive those small cars with small engines because they are such caring creatures and Americans love their obscenely huge cars with insanely large engines because they are such fill the blank.  I do believe there is large amount of excess and waste in so-called American way of life.  However, I also believe everybody else in the world would have done the same if given a chance.On fuel price subject, I think it is fair to expect significant changes in domestic market.  While crude price went up the same for everybody, gas prices went up more here than anywhere else, in relative terms.  This is because in other countries taxes are much higher percentage of the price (up to 80%) and most of which is flat portion.  In other words, insane taxation of fuel in Europe causing high prices at the first place, cushioned the gas price runup when crude over quadrupled from in 2000s. American consumer on the other hand saw every move in crude translated to almost equally proportional move in gas price.  Suddenly, those who owned Explorers and Blazers, as their family and commuting cars could not bear the increased cost.  So I think we will see significant convergence of the markets.  Europeans are liking those taller crossovers almost as much as Americans (many just can't afford them) and Americans will have to learn to like fewer cubic inches, cylinders and even less space in certain conditions."

2823,markcincinnati,"June 20, 2013 7:56AM","Yesterday, our local Infiniti store had a ""party"" of sorts for the 2014 Q50.  Food, drink, customized wine glasses and a 4MB thumb drive key-chain were the ""Thanks for coming"" gifts offered to this -- public invited -- coming out party for the new Q50.Overall, I would say the event was under-attended.  Although there was some mention of the event in the local Cincinnati newspaper, no special invitation to current Infiniti owners was sent out (we have a 2011 FX35 coming off lease in about 6 months).Present at the event: the Infiniti dealership sales team, one factory rep and one ""marketing rep"" (a representative of a company hired by Infiniti to test the Q50 against an Audi A4 and a BMW 3 series.)  My wife and I stayed for about an hour (of the four hour show) -- a ""pre-production"" Q50S w/AWD fully optioned was on display and we were encouraged to try out the front and rear seats and especially to get behind the wheel. The car had been used throughout the day to train the reps -- and it had been, according to the factory rep, driven hard by some of the more adventurous Infiniti sales team members.The car -- no matter if you think it is attractive or not -- is different looking (by far) from the pictures many of us have seen in print and on-line. My impression of the in-person view is that the Q50 exterior is beautiful. The interior is Audi-nice -- which is about as high of a compliment as I can give for anyone's automotive interior rendering.The dash, the electronics, the gauges, pedals, switch gear, etc etc etc are all ""jewel-like"" -- the interior is a major upgrade over even the current M cars -- in fact, the new Q50 has to be the nicest Infiniti (inside and out) ever.My wife -- a conservative attorney, not subject to hyper-ventalating -- remarked ""this may very well be a game changer for Infinti."" My comment -- written here previously -- to the factory rep was that Infinti will know it has ""arrived"" when Car & Driver, et al, proclaim the BMW 3 series as ""the German Infiniti,"" since, thus far, the praise heaped on Infiniti's G cars goes something like ""Infiniti's G37, the Japanese BMW.""We'll know if Infiniti has knocked it out of the park when the shoe is on the other foot.The Q50 according to the marketing representative was track-tested against an Audi A4 2.0T with sport package and against a BMW 328i (with x-drive) also with sport package.Now, at first blush, this seems like an unfair comparison:  the Infiniti has a 325+ HP V6, HUGE brakes (with 4-piston stoppers on the front) and sport everything. By comparison, the two Germans were equipped with their manufacturer's turbo 4s and sport packages.One look at the specs of the three compared cars, and the Germans appear totally out-gunned.  It's no wonder, then, that the Infiniti Q50S out accelerated, out handled -- out ran, overall -- the boys from the Fatherland.  I asked the Infiniti factory rep why they didn't compare the Q50 to an Audi S4 or a BMW 335, since the specifications of the Infiniti would seem to call for the German hot rods to be able to call it a fair fight.The answer from the Infiniti factory rep was that they compared similar sized cars, similar ""class"" cars, similarly equipped (lux options) cars at the same price points.  For the Germans to be completely equipped and comparable to the Infiniti would have meant checking off the S4 and 335 variants of the Audi and BMW respectively.Infinti reckons -- apparently -- that a $51,000+ Q50S AWD can be compared against an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series only if the Audi and BMW are equipped with their turbo 4-cylinders.  The apples to apples comparison would require the $51,000 Q50S to be compared with an Audi or BMW that would cost between $10,000 and $12,000 more.Infiniti hopes (I assume) that Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend and Road & Track will see the light and only test the Q50 against other cars based on price.  Based on my years of reading these enthusiasts magazines, I'd wager the Q50 will be compared to S4's and 335i's and price be damned.However, against what can be had from a German sports sedan for $51,000, there's little doubt in my mind that the $51,000 Infiniti Q50 will kick their butts.The factory rep said the target buyer is someone who will consider an Audi A4 or BMW 3 and the new Lexus IS.  ""Not so much comparison is likely to happen with the Q50 against the Cadillac ATS or the Mercedes C,"" so says the factory rep.After absorbing about as much as one person can, without a test drive, we then went over about three doors to the Lexus dealer where a new IS 350 F-Sport AWD was on-display.  Like the Q50, the IS350 looks different in person -- but unlike the Q50, the IS 350 is LESS attractive (to me, at least) in person -- yet there is something that MAY make the 350 more attractive: its price.  A well optioned 2014 Lexus IS 350 AWD F-Sport was $48,000 including shipping.  Infiniti may need to consider sub-venting their lease offerings -- since the IS350 does seem to be a worthy rival.In pictures, the IS's interior wins -- in person, it appears more ""industrial"" and, for me that translates to, less attractive -- your mileage may differ.We're at a point-of-inflection here folks -- two mighty fine cars have power-slided onto the scene.  Updated Audis and BMW's better be in the queue REAL SOON.  :surprise:"

I'm not interested in the RWD version, since we simply have too many days where the coefficient of friction is low -- but I can't imagine (even in Cincinnati) there wouldn't be a market for an RWD Q50.I'm guessing that it is easier to sell AWD to someone as an upgrade to RWD than the other way around."

2831,igozoomzoom,"June 24, 2013 3:14PM","speaking of volvo s60- they sold more of them (last month, May sales) then honda sold Tl's and TSXs--end of Acura coming soon?? - for more sales numbers click on linkThe Volvo S60 is an a very good car- looks good, drives good, good value depending on model/options.  The Acura TL, even with the DESPERATELY NEEDED 2012 nose job and butt lift, is still not an appealing design...not as ugly as the 2009 TL, but few if any cars are uglier than that!At the height of its popularity, the TL sold 78,218 units in 2005.  Even the 2008 model sold 48,766 cars.  But the 2009-2012 TL has only sold in the low 30s each year, topping out at 34,049 in 2010.2013 YTD Figures at May EOM aren't looking very good either.  So far, the TL has sold 12,434 units this year which is down 15.3% (or 2242 units) compared to this time last year.My beloved, but ignored and soon to be discontinued, TSX is faring much worse.  Year to date, it has only sold 7,746 compared to 15,012 at this point in 2012.  That's a decrease of 48.4% or 7266 fewer cars.The ILX is hardly setting any records, but it has sold 9,217 units YTD.  That is almost 2000 more sales than the TSX has lost compared to last year, so people are obviously buying the ILX instead of the TSX.  But the ILX desperately needs to replace the underpowered 150hp 2.0L engine used in all models with the 5-speed A/T!  I've driven a 2013 ILX Premium with the 2.0L 5AT and I was genuinely impressed with the car until I pulled onto the highway!  0-60mph takes 9.5 seconds, dead-even with the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent with 6-speed A/T!  Even the cheap-as-dirt Nissan Versa 1.6 CVT can hang neck-and-neck at 9.8 seconds.That kind of performance is tolerable, if mediocre, on a $15k car.  But on a $30k 'Premium' entry-level luxury or near-luxury model, it's simpy UNACCEPTABLE!  Especially from a company that is known for making some great high-performance 4-cylinder engines!Acura was doing just fine with until 2009 when the godawful ""Power Plenum"" (aka- 'The Shield' and 'The Beak') corporate fascia debuted!  Despite immediate negative response from the media and consumers and plunging sales figures, they defiantly insisted that it was the new look of Acura....and it wasn't nor has it been pretty since! =(I have owned seven Honda/Acura vehicles in my 24 years of driving.  I've owned nine different cars in my life, and was a die-hard Honda loyalist from the day I got my license in 1990 until 2006 when I saw the new Civic and walked away!  Actually, I drove off the lot in shock and terrified at the prospect of shopping for anything other than a Honda.  But after some research and test drives, I found myself right at home with a 2006 Mazda3 and now I have a 2012 CX-9 GT.But the best car I've ever driven (and the best car ever made, in my humble opinion) was my 1994 Acura Legend L 4-door.  I bought it in 1997 when it was returned at the end of a 36-month lease.  It was Frost White with Taupe Cloth and 5-speed manual, but that was exactly how I wanted it.  I drove until May 2001 when I was t-boned by a speeding F250 work truck running a red light as I was making a left turn.  I barely survived, but my Legend did not. =(It's sad to see Acura where it is today.  I've felt much the same way about Honda for the last several years also. But the 2013 Accord is so good and so much better than the 2008-2012 model that it replaced....perhaps there's hope after all?"
2832,m6user,"June 24, 2013 5:35PM","The RDX is selling very, very well and the MDX is still a very good seller.  Guess which models Acura makes more profit on?  So sales of certain models doesn't necessarily spell disaster as it's overall profit that counts.  Of course making good proift on all your lines is preferable but as long as you're making money it's not exactly like you're going to go out of business.  Accords didn't so so well over the past 5 years but several other models like the CRX, Odyssey, Civic and Pilot sold well and with good profit margins.Bottom line, just looking at sales numbers of a couple of models is a fools delight.  Acura is one good redesign away from being on track again with the TL and one good engine to make the ILX a good seller.  Along with the very profitable MDX and RDX sales they will be just fine."
2833,sweendogy,"June 24, 2013 6:42PM","While I agree the mdx (and its now a new mdx) and rdx sell well, very well they do not sell in numbers to keep the brand alone- look at the sales numbers for every other car they produce and they are mid pack at best in terms of sales- mind you mid pack means massive discounts and minimal If any profit.  Honda on the other hand no matter how bad the previous accord and  civic looked they stll were near the top of the sales chain. I would also note that when the last civic was being slammed they quickly fixed it because its the real bread and butter of the brand.Acura is one good redesign away from selling some cars for sure- but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that.Sales numbers tell the story, they sold 200k crvs in 2011 and when they did a redu they were very careful not to mess that up. Something they failed to do with the tsx and TL."

Simple, handsome exterior, I still think it looks good.  Power, handling, good ride, decent mpg, nice interior, well built and reliable.  6.5 years, 85,000 trouble free, Zaino-shiny miles.When the '09 came out, I was pretty shocked and upset at the path the Acura stylists had taken.  While I may be no arbiter of style, I was fairly sure Acura was going to take a hit on TL sales.  Of course, the Beak being the most obvious flaw.  But the rest of the car just seemed overwrought and heavy-looking to me.Talking to Acura rep at the New England Auto Show, the first thing he noted was that the beak could be painted to make it less obtrusive.  Now, there's a selling point...We've had several Acura's in my family, nothing but good experiences.  I hope that they can reclaim the prior gen TL's glory.  And, I'm not sure the RLX will be the answer to anyone's question.  Hopefully, a good car, but the styling, IMHO, not so much."

You're right about one thing....they do need a midlevel sedan with great looks which may or may not be the new TLX.You talk about discounts without having a clue as to what the real margins are.

It's just like volume...it means nothing unless you can make a good buck at it.no but why didnt they chaange it earlier- like they did the civic of 2012??Ummhh...they screwed up.  That's the car I was referring to that they have to change drastically and it needs to be a winner.  However, even if they don't get it absolutely perfect the sky is not going to fall.  Sorry.I think you could make some of the same comments about Infiniti.  I love Infiniti but they have pulled some real boners too.  And some of their models are real low in the sales numbers but they seem to plugging along fairly well without the huge sales numbers....just like Acura.  Acura may be doing even better because their SUV sales are better than Infiniti's and that's where a ton of profit is.  Just like Ford and GM with their trucks/suvs.  Not saying it's the best of all worlds but as far as making profit it works pretty well."

What a novel idea.....stock what people buy.Having said that, I can see no reason why any car can't be special ordered with the trans of choice.  If it costs a little more because it may be a glitche in the production routine than charge a little more to the customer.  If a customer really wants something and is willing to pay why not provide it.  Now when it comes to station wagons, that's a whole different ballgame because of a number of possible reasons including crash tests, EPA tests, availability of repair parts, component suppliers, etc."

A lot of manufactures offer sticks in their entry level models so I wouldn't think just a tranny difference would be much of a player.Dealers in Europe often have a very small footprint and car buying is almost exclusively by order.  When the U.S. started selling cars there was plenty of land to spread out and build huge dealerships so  a big part of the difference in mindset was the availability of space.  Sames as car size.  Long, wide roads equaled land yachts!  Europe and Asian roads on the most part in cities and countryside are much narrower and for the most part, cover shorter distances.   IMO if their auto industry had grown up with the wide open spaces that were the norm in the U.S. things would be much different."

Quite the insiders view of the car world and the greed it spawned.Remember, this was back in the day when there weren't enough Accords (and Civics) to go around, all dealers had the 'markup' tag on them and there was the voluntary import restrictions agreed to by the major Japanese auto makers (so as to give the Big 3 a fighting chance).Many of the senior sales executives at Honda were convicted.

2849,dino001,"June 11, 2013 9:25AM","I was challenged here some time ago to produce evidence of modern diesel needing more maintenance.  At the time I could  not produce it, although I heard that assertion multiple times from people who know more about cars than I do.  Now I have it - BMW will pay for its gasoline engines oil changes every 15K/2 years, while for its new diesel (328d) the period is 10K/1 year.  That is tangible evidence that modern diesel engine requires more attention.  Oil change is usually just a tip of the iceberg.  I'm reasonably confident there is more.   Nothing comes free.  Diesel engines used to be very insensitive to fuel, now they are very sensitive (due to clean diesel), which mean any kind of impurities will adversely affect durability and service - in turn I'll expect more extensive work required to keep them up.  It's all exact opposite to what's used to be.  Old diesels were clunky, noisy, stinky and slow, but super durable and resistant to abuse.  Many were naturally aspirated.  Modern diesels are quiter, smoother, faster, all are turbocharged.  As and engineer, I can say with some authority, there was a price somewhere.  I'm guessing (just a man's opinion) it will be in lifespan and service.  I'd not be surprised if their useful life came close to their gasoline counterparts and milion milers were things of the past."
2850,flightnurse,"June 11, 2013 9:42AM",If BMW is offering 4yr/50K free  maintenance then what is the problem?

Since there is no info on this as of yet.
2851,dino001,"June 11, 2013 10:14AM","The problem is post ""free"" period.  Some people keep their cars longer than three years.  The allure of diesels has always been their long life.  If you trade every three years, of course no problem for you, just the next guy."
2852,dino001,"June 11, 2013 11:25AM","Don't ask me, I'm not the one yearning for diesel.To be fair, the depreciation on diesel may be better than gas, so you may get some of the upfront cost back at trading.  But the whole idea of diesel is to lower your costs of ownership.  One doesn't do that through 3-year trading cycle.  At that point depreciation, even a better one, is still by far greatest portion of ownership.  My orginal thesis was one gets the diesel (or at least used to) to keep it long, longer than gasoline powered car, as diesels are supposed to last longer.  Moreover, the car was supposed to take some abuse on the way, as diesels used to.   However, the clean diesel technology may be one that drives stake through that thesis.  If diesels require more maintenance, got more fragile due to tougher emission standards and may not last as long ... again, why would one want a diesel?  Oh, to save $500 per year on fuel. Ahhhhh.  I see.  So we spend couple of thousands more for new, another couple of thousand more on maintenance (maybe, we don't know it yet, but the early indications are there) then we shake and pray every time we pour the fuel (what if that fuel is not as pure as it's supposed to?), drive around with clacking noise looking for next gas station... Then at 100K-150K miles it croaks same way gasoline engine does...  All to save us cool 500 bucks per year.  WOW!!!I'm excaggerating here, of course, but so far I'm not convinced.  However, I admit, this installment of diesel from BMW looks much more legitimate than the previous 55+ grand speed monster 335d."

2854,dino001,"June 11, 2013 1:53PM","Yeah, I don't know that either, what I know it is much more than ol' good diesel of the past.  I suspect it may be more than gas for one reason  - due to the nature of fuel burning in diesel chamber (much higher pressures), the ability to control that burning clean may require much heavier computer involvement - but that's again my guess.  It is based on how big of a deal it was to introduce ULSD fuel.  The resistance was not just because of the fuel cost, but because of the additional cost of the engines (which probably comes from electronics) and the fact that lack of sulphur is supposedly damaging to old engines.  Something to do with lubrication, don't know the details.  There must be heavy electronics in that thing to run so smooth vs. old diesels."

We also have diesel price higher than premium gas here in Tampa, sometimes as much as 10%, it is seasonal.  It never goes even close to regular gas range, which means a decent regular gas four cylinder Honda/Toyota is really way to go for somebody focused on economy.  This being ELLPS forum, focusing on fuel economy, especially through diesel technology, seems slightly out of place.I think it's classic ""legend"" thing - people heard that overseas it's popular, so they assume it must be such a great thing.  I welcome choice, so I think it's great that they make a first seemingly legitimate attempt to introduce diesel as economic proposition.  So far it was only VW that offered a legitimate choice.  I don't count 55+ grand rich people toys from Benz or BMW as such.It is a bit strange that the diesel focus is on sedans rather than say SUVs and crossovers, where diesels would much more appropriate.  I'd welcome diesel powered CRV, Forester, Rogue, Escape, Explorer and like - or workhorse 1/2 ton pickup trucks.  That's were diesel would be just great, IMHO - not necessarily in 3-series.  So why it is BMW/Benz spearheading this, not Honda, Nissan, or Toyota?

The F30 with a 2-liter Turbo diesel (320D) is a bit different than the same chassis sporting a 300hp 3 liter gas turbo motor (335i)   Perhaps they ought to have something like F30-TD2.0 or F30-T3.0 on the tail.I would bet a cup of fancy coffee that the vast majority of BMW drivers/owners/leasers, many being the mcmanion [sic]variety, have never heard of E or F numbers.I'm not sure about the ""vast"" majority, I'm sure most owners have no clue but enthusiasts know.

And the winner is... Lexus  :surprise:  :surprise:  :surprise:  :surprise: On Car and Driver, high priests of BMW cult machine!!   There were some knockouts of other magazines before. I remember many years ago Automobile or Road and Track put G350 over 330i, but the win was mostly on ground of value, as G was proclaimed a bit worse, but price difference made it win on adjusted score.  But this time it is C&D.  Moreover, the IS won was based on driving experience, not some secondary metrics.  The biggest complaint against 335i was the miserable steering feel, which was pretty much what I thought myself on that 328i loaner.  This is basically telling me BMW gave up on being true enthusiast sports sedan, or succumbed to gas mileage pressure.  Electromechanical steering probably gives them extra mpg's.I am pretty positive that Lexus win was not because it's such a  great car to drive (I mean, it probably is a fine car, but I doubt it all of the sudden became true ""driver's car""), but it is BMW that changed so much.  As others (Caddy, Lexus) are figuring out how much make a nice sports sedan, BMW seems to be in process of progressive amnesia, or worse - flat out rejection.  I guess the market of badge and big back seat seekers is simply too large to ignore.  This is a bit sad, but the market wizzes from BMW decided the small enthsiast folk got nowhere to go anyway, so no need to care what they want."

Personally, I found the ATS (both 3.6 and 2.0 turbo) to be coarse (much like the new 4 cyl turbo BMWs that NYC speaks about and the older G 3.7).  The performance delta between the 3.6 V6 and the 2.0 4 cyl turbo is negligible. And, despite the ballyhoo Cadillac bombarded us with, it has not sold to expectations.The good news is, you can buy a G37 cheap right now.  Just helped my sister buy a TL SH AWD (still one of my all time favorites).  Good deals on those, too.It's hard to beat the smoothness and the sounds the 6 cyl engines in the BMWs, Acuras, Audis, Mercedes, Lexus.  BMW should take some lessons from Audi with regards to how to build a smooth, torquey 4 cyl turbo.Kind of wanting to drive the Lexus ES after seeing that article.  Closest I ever came to owning a Lexus was a few years ago, when the IS350 first hit the streets.  Only reason I didn't was the dealership(s) didn't like that I wanted to make a skinny deal on one.

2903,dino001,"May 31, 2013 4:05AM","I always wanted new versions and was excited with every new launch.  I'm an option hog, newer cars tend to have more equipment standard and more optional.  They usually have stronger engines, better transmissions.  The chassis are usually stiffer and the ride is usually a bit more refined within each model's target audience.  All those were reasons why I liked new models over outgoing ones.  New 3-series improves a lot of things on paper - it has more torque (328 anyway), better automatic transmission, it finally has rear split folddown seat standard (but of course 320i does not).  It is larger, which majority wanted, but I did not.However, there are significant steps back in this model that are important for many who bought previous generations - disastorous steering feedback (I could not believe how bad it was - if it were a Buick I'd say fine, that's how GM positions those cars, but for BMW it is TERRIBLE).  The interior has been downgraded - larger space came at cost of quality of plastic switches (they feel harder, more like downscale car) and even iDrive does not feel the same - my old one has a ""graded"" hump feel with each notch, the new one is a flat ratchet.  I know it's nitpicking, but I feel entitled to nitpick a car that came with almost 5 grand price increase (effectively) over old model.  Yes, the price is another issue - it is flat out ridiculous.  Well equipped 328 goes over 50 grand in a snap (my 328 wagon with Nav, convenience pack, sports pack and premium pack stickered at $46K), 335 shoots to almost 60 grand if you like any of nice conveniences.  50/60 grand for THIS???"

It's all about cheap lease deals and high demand - which BMW has cornered the market in getting people in - I think they will do very well with this new redo as it prob addresses issues with the prev (f30?) car had that the non enthusiast mass lease buyers complained about- and blame you have the ultimate leasing machine.

Sure the engine has had many awards and pulls like a mofo . But look at sales (10 years) of maximas, pathfinders , and to a lesser extent large rogue (name excapes me) and tell me it saved the brand? Maybe you mean saved Infiniti ?I think what saved Nissan was a quality 4 door sedan with a 4cyl - that undercut the Camry a bit on pricing- might have been a little edgier looking and performed a touch better in base form and had more standard stuff."

If its a feeling it saved the brand again it's a feeling, not fact.Facts- Look at the April sales numbers for the Nissan division - top 3 cars sold- Altima, roque, sentra- infact they made up 50% all sales. Number four was the versa.Btw they sold more jukes then they sold xteras, Maronos, titans and quests- and the maxima outsold the juke by 200 cars for the month.

Sure the Germans as you say invented the category - but as you can see from the right hand column they make up less then half the field."
2913,dino001,"June 1, 2013 7:37AM","My issue is BMW is not nearly as luxurious inside, especially in their base trims, as say Audi or MB.  Wood inlays really improve the look, also some of those touches you get with those Lux, Sport or M-line packages.  The base aluminum trim is quite dull, if you ask me.  Their dashboard consoles always look like a 1980s recycle, the competition is light years ahead in styling of the dials and gauges, or center area.  It was allright when BMW was the true athlete of the bunch, one took it because the looks didn't count, it was the driving.  However, when the steering disaster of those F-coded models took hold, suddenly I ask myself, why would I pay 5 extra grand for this (of course once it is time for my current car to go).  So far the only way I see BMW winning me over is by those ""peripheral"" models like GT, wagon, or perhaps X1, or X3.  I find it easy to imagine that those are still sportiest of their peers.  Nobody else makes proper wagons anymo, i.e. sedan from hood to center pillar, extended back, no stupid raised suspensions, body claddings or other crossover crap. I believe TSX will be gone soon,  so the new 328 wagon may be still in the mix just because there is nothing else left, unless new CTS will still feature wagon.  335 GT could have been a good alternative - killer engine, great space arrangement, but from early reports the steering and suspension are even more vague and soft than sedan/wagon.  But is there anything like that around?  The rest is the crossover stuff.  If I did cross over, indeed, perhaps Audi Allroad - never tried that one.  Honda Crosstour or Subaru Outback, if I wanted to save some money.  But it's not the same thing than proper sporty wagon.  Those are practically dead.For now I'm committed to hold onto my 328 wagon.

If there was any sense to it the 528i would be called the 520T(T for turbo).  It's time to drop the dopey ""i""-for (fuel) injection which made sense back in the 70s when most cars were still carbuerated.As for the E39 being the last great 5er, Jeremy Clarkson calls it the last ""mechanical"" Five Series and I tend to agree.

By all accounts the M- badged cars are very enthusiast-oriented and deliver terrific performance but they're also very expensive and it's true that they no longer make an entry-level luxury car that is very performance oriented, I guess they figure us poor people can buy Minis."

While they love being coddled by the dealership, they don't like the prices they pay for maintenance and repair.  Getting a 3rd party mechanic that you trust would probably help.Just thinking out loud, if the OP wants a bigger vehicle that fits 3 in the back, an Acura MDX, or Lexus RX, or an Infiniti JX would probably be the better fit.  I don't think many cars in his price range are going to be big enough for 3 passengers in the rear (along with car seats :surprise: ).I have an independent mechanic I use once my vehicles are out of warranty.  He has a great philosophy.  If you're buying a car to last you 5-10 years, by a Japanese brand.  If you're buying a car for 3 years, buy German.

2961,plekto,"April 27, 2013 11:22AM","One thing I note is that a lot of the cars mentioned are smaller euro-sedans.  And while this is fine, if you want a large car, you're looking at a Big Lexus, Acura, Cadillac, Mercedes, Volvo, Audi, or BMW.   Others do make similar cars, but they tend to be overpriced or far more sport than luxury.A quick run - down:Acura.  Pretty much the TL.  It's basically a Japanese Buick Park Avenue.  That's not a bad thing, as the Park Avenue was a fine car with nice seats, acceptable features, and a very nice and soft ride.  That it cost GM almost 35K to make each one was a whole other story.Lexus.  Pretty much the ES here, since it is based on the Camry platform.  It's a clone of the TL, pretty much, aside from styling.  Both are excellent highway cruisers and will last a very long time.   There also is the Avalon, which is a nice choice a well.Volvo is a bit more interesting.  They have always driven markedly better than their American or Japanese counterparts.  A little bit of sport to go with the luxury.  The S80 is a great vehicle and I'd honestly rather be driving one instead of yet another faceless jellybean (ie - Acura or Lexus).On to Mercedes.  Their E class is a bit smaller than you'd probably like.  It's also as it has always been, a mediocre in-between car.   The Problem is also that unless you're looking at CPO, you're going to be out of your price-range.   That said, a 2 or 3 year old S class might be worth contemplating if you like Mercedes.  Something that just came off of an executive lease.Of the models to be looking at, the S350 Bluetec is the one to consider.  It gets 21/31 mpg (better than the hybrid S class, even), and while it isn't a tire-smoking monster like the S550 is, it's not slow, either.  Would I personally buy a used S over a brand new Lexus?   In a heartbeat.*note - wait until this fall of course, as depreciation will help you out.  Currently, CPO 2012 S350s run around $75K.  Expect that to be $60K this fall.  A bit over your budget, but it's a stunning option that nobody would fault you for choosing.BMW?  It's pretty much the 5 series.  You simply can't go wrong with one.Audi is the A6.  It's pretty much trying to be a 5 series clone.  I'd call this the same as the Japanese rivalry between Lexus and Acura.And, lastly, we have the underdog, Cadillac.  Now, don't count them out immediately.  They hit a home run with the CTS and it's only real fault is that the size was wrong.  It simply can't fit more than four adults comfortably.  Which it does as well as anything from Europe, I might add.  And it handles great as well.  It also has a much better GPS system than anything Mercedes or BMW has.  The Mercedes GPS is sometimes so bad that you'd really be better off with your cell phone in a holder.So GM fixed that with an extended wheelbase version, the XTS.   Of note as well is the magnetic ride suspension, which is usually only found in exotic cars.  The thing drives and rides as well as a S class.  But it's not $100K.  Not even close.  It's my personal favorite of the list because it's so inexpensive, especially if you can find a CPO/lease return one.  (these usually have 3 or 5K miles on them and are essentially new, except that someone else ate the initial depreciation, taxes, and registration.  Their credit woes are your gain.http://www.tracymotors.com/VehicleDetails/certified-2013-Cadillac-XTS-3.6L_V6_FW- D-Plymouth-MA/1954964653A typical example.Note - this is a smart thing to do with any new car, actually."

2965,plekto,"April 29, 2013 6:22PM","Well, sport suspension and tires, plus a massively heavy AWD system that 90% of people will never benefit from are a whole other animal.   The base model is, styling aside, a big, well built FWD car that drives a lot like a Park Avenue Ultra did.  The better GM cars didn't have a problem with handling if you got the touring or sport package.As for the Audi, yes, I personally think that the A6 is better than the 5, but if I said that at first, I'd have had fifty BMW fanboys spamming me with hate-mail.  But it's small, really if you're coming from a normal family sedan.  Any of these will feel and drive superbly.The differences between the Avalon and the Camry are kind of like the XTS and the CTS.  They share enough DNA to be hard to guess what comes from what.  Either way, the ES is a good big car that is great for long drives.  My only gripe is that Honda and Toyota overprice their cars by about 10-20%.  And they never have meaningful incentives, either.  That I can actually get a better deal at the end of a year on a Mercedes is telling.Oh, I'd like to add one more car, just for fun.  The Lincoln MKS.  It's basically the new version of the Towncar, and it is a long, long overdue update at that.  Of note is how it will fit five large male adults with winter coats on inside it in comfort.   Like the GM, you get a lot of car for your money compared to the Japanese and European brands."
2966,graphicguy,"April 30, 2013 4:44AM","pletko...I see where you're coming from.  Those old Buick Park Aves with the handling package and supercharged V6 motors were pretty good cars.  Base TL, while still a better handling car and a better performing car...I could see a comparison made.Now, TL SH AWD is really a different animal.  I don't know that anyone drives any car to its true capabilities.  That said, when I had my TL SH AWD, I know the handling benefits could be felt every day....around corners, better steering feel, confidence on twisting roads.  None of that touches it's prowess in wet/snowy weather (which was excellent).I agree with you on the A6 vs the BMW 5 series.  For the money, I'd choose the A6 (3.0) all day, every day.  It's better car to drive.  And, the tech that comes with that level of car is better than the 5.  The A6 handles better, rides better, too.  Plus, it will come in a few thousand under the 5 series equipped like for like.Can't comment on the big Caddy.  The only ones I've had any seat time in are the CTS and the ATS....neither of which would be on my short list if I were plunking down my own money.  Strong rumors around that the ATS is falling short of GM's sales expectations and they're throwing trunk money at it."
2967,flightnurse,"April 10, 2013 8:58AM","Yes, Dino the prices you have are right and the last 5 generation of the ES was built from the Camry Chassis. This current generation is built of the Toyota Avalon. So, which one got the better deal, the Avalon or the ES?"
2968,dino001,"April 10, 2013 9:07AM","Can't tell, never looked at them.  I suspect Avalon is better per pound or cubic foot, but ES is likely nicer and probably will have some unique touches.  Not sure, if that's enough and what is the real price difference for ""equivalent"" configurations."

2971,graphicguy,"April 11, 2013 5:27AM","I remember a point in time that buying a Lexus....any Lexus...meant MSRP only.  When the IS first came out, I was mildly interested in one.  Aside from them being relatively underpowered, they handled decently.  And, they certainly had the interior ""eye candy"" appeal.I recall walking into the showroom to eyeball a particularly pretty dark grey metallic one that was sitting there.  Salesperson approached, asked if I liked it.  I told him I didn't know much about them.  I remember him clearly....""let's go familiarize you with it.""He pulled it out of the showroom and off we went.  Again, it wasn't very fast (especially given that it was supposed to be a sports sedan), but it showed quality and smoothness I had never experienced before.I had the inevitable question....""so, on this particular model, is there a price in mind you'd like to throw out there?""He pointed to the sticker.I countered...""so, if I said I was interested right now for....say....&1,000 off MSRP, you wouldn't take it?""""NOPE""!""$500 off?""""NOPE""$100 off?""NOPE""Contrast that to a year or so ago.  I found an IS 350 (next gen from the one I had test driven years ago) that I was very mildly interested in.  Went for a test drive again (same dealer, different sales person).  Some of the same impressions I had originally...high quality, very smooth.  But, this one had some ""oooomph"" under the hood.Still, it really wasn't my cup of tea.Big difference, the sales person threw out a number without me even asking that was almost $2K off MSRP.Gotta admit, Lexus makes some very high quality cars.  They seem to just miss the mark compared to others I might be in the market for at any given time."
2972,dino001,"April 11, 2013 10:12AM","I initially thought BMW will bring 320d.  It is actually bringing 328d, which I suspect will have higher/similar torque to 328i, nominally lower power (as all diesels do due to lower revs).  They announce 45 mpg highway.  Say it's true.  Let's also assume it will be priced between 328i and 335i, so starting MSRP in low-mid 40s ($43K-$45K) sprinting to $50K with just leather and couple of conveniences.  Price difference about 3-5 grand with 328 and about 10+ with 320i (which is also stripped vs. 328i, not just engine). Taking them at face value we get 45 mpg highway vs 33 mpg (AT), good difference.  I would caution excuberrance, as I have seen in the past other manufacturers promising outlandish values on their diesels in preanouncements to end up as much as 10 mpg lower after EPA tests (that was the case with new VW diesel).  So let's assume 15 thousand miles per year, five years of ownership, 75K miles.  Lets assume MSRP of $45K (328i) vs $48K (328d), i.e. we have some options, all miles are highway (for simplicity) - we get:1. 328i:  2272 gallons of premium at say $3.75/gal (number vary) = $8522 for five years.2. 328d: 1705 gallons of diesel at say $3.90/gal (number vary) = $6647 for five yearsAmount saved:  $1874.  Anticipated new car price difference: $3-$5K.  The only other variable is depreciation.  Say we get 5% better depreciation of 328d, say 55% vs. 60% of depreciation $26.4K vs. $27K.In conclusion, not including higher taxes and financing (loan, lease), assuming MSRP as benchmark, 328d comes up overall $2500-$3000 less expensive over 5 years.  To me it's nothing, especially because:1. 328i will likely enjoy better discount at purchase than 328d2. If leased, 328i will likely enjoy better money factor than 328d; lower residual may offset that.3. People who keep their cars less than 5 years will see even smaller fuel savings.4. Diesel prices are even more volataile than gasoline.  It is easy to imagine increase of the difference in price per gallon by another 10 or 15 cents.There are a lot of other factors that could make the calculus more attractive for the diesel, but there are many other factors that could offset that, too.  This was intented to be a demonstration how I would make a calculation if I had all the data, including mixed mileage, trying to take emotion out and account for all variables, not just one that is visible (mpg).  I completely understand the gas mileage focus.  It is easy to let go and forget about the costs that are already ""set"", like car payments.  They are planned and accounted in home budget, out of sight, out of mind.  But the gas bill comes every week or so, varies, even though it is planned, it springs up all the time and every unplanned trip adds to the bill.  So it is easy to think that if I save on gas, I will spend less money overall.  But that may or may not be true.  Without a cold meticulous calculation there is no way to tell.  Yet people rush to ""do something"" in every time gas price jumps 30 cents."
2973,andres3,"April 11, 2013 5:04PM","Warranty= probably a year more.That can be huge as one expensive fix can run 4 figures easily and if something is going to break, most likely it'll be in that ""extra"" year."

2975,ivan_99,"April 11, 2013 7:56PM",All I want is a small diesel in a well-made car with a manual transmission.A colleague recently purchased a Passat TDI manual and loves it...or a Mazda 6?  Not in BMW league but I'd still classify as well-made.
2976,alltorque,"April 12, 2013 4:35AM","I drove similarly sized and powered A4 and Peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. Both of those were considered on of best diesel engines of their generations.Agree with all of that although small diesels can be OK with an MT.  Torque comes in very low down so they'll happily pull you up a cliff in what your mind tells you is too high a gear. ATs are better though. I have a Volvo S60 D5 (185) Geartronic. Nice combination.I had 2x Peugeot 406's. Probably the best riding cars I've ever had. That was when Peugeot made great chassis/suspension set-ups. No more, it seems.That Pug diesel and the VW Group 1.9 TDi PD engines are the stuff of legend and probably did more to move Europe to small diesels than any other. The 130bhp 1.9 TDi PD in my old Skoda Fabia vRS was a brilliant combination in a light car, and the 6MT was just built for playing with the mountain of torque the engine produced. Happy days."
2977,dino001,"April 12, 2013 11:03AM","180 hp for diesel is a lot.  I think calling it 328d is appropriate here, as the 280 lb-ft torque is even larger than 328i (much shorter though, of course).   IMHO the renaming to 328d is also a tell regarding the expected price.  If past history is to guide us, it is reasonable to expect price differential similar to  that between E90-based 335d and 335i.The 45 mpg is now mentioned on their website.  I remain slightly skeptical, but if BMW learned VW lesson, perhaps it will be more accurate.  VW made a huge blunder preanouncing in big letters over 50 mpg on the new Jetta and delivering nowhere near that number after EPA testing.  I was joking that they must have mixed up kilometers per imperial gallon with mpg. It wasn't that bad, but the blunder was obvious.  The embarrasment was so big that VW challenged their users to a survey on real life numbers.  Talking spin doctors - Joe from Ohio says he got 56 mpg, so should you!I also heard that EPA mpg number is based not just on real testing, but also on extrapolation calculations based on that testing.  It is basically is a good predictor for traditional gas engines, but it reportedly completely breaks down on hybrids (overestimates mpg) and has some significant flaws on diesels (presumable underestimates).  I don't know if that is really true, but it would make sense why some hybrids are so off when it comes to the mileage.Many immediately smelled big conspiracies and foul play, but to me a botched methodology due to using calculations outside of their intended class of problem (happens all the time in engineering), seem much more reasonable explanation for the blunder.  I simply don't think Toyota, Ford, or Honda were purposly misleading consumers.  They simply run tests and calcs according to EPA guidelines, but those turned to be wrong for new technology.I agree with your last statement - diesels are not for everybody.  They definitely have their place in personal vehicle market (e.g. taxi cabs, SUVs, pickup trucks), especially for those traveling often large distances at constant speeds.  American aversion was a bit overdone.  However, they are not cure for cancer, either.I wonder how much more 328d will cost. If they misprice it, they may kill it before it shows up."

2980,flightnurse,"April 13, 2013 9:25PM","Dino when it comes to MPG the diesel engine will make more MPG as the engine get miles. In regards to the VW, when new the Golf, Jetta and other VW cars with the TDI get good miles when new, however, the more miles on the engine the better the MPG, on the Diesel forum people post their real world MPG and it is amazing to see the difference. I'm thinking the same will be said with the 328d, put 10-15K on the engine and a true mid 40s on the highway would be doable. The true value of the diesel is not to  own it for 3 years (lease) and then turn it in, but to own it for 10 yrs.In regards to price, I would assume base would be around 38-40K. It will be interesting to see where MB will price the C class diesel and GLK diesel.  AS well as the Audi A4 Diesel, and from what I read the Audi TDI will have more HP 180hp and 240lbs...  An interesting time for diesels in the US."

So this is off my list now.328 - Wow!!  What a car.  Loved the way it drove.  Simply amazing.   I would have bought this one except the size.  Little too small for family of 5.  So thought will drive 528.528 - Not as good of a drive as 328, but still great.   The price tag is very high.  Was thinking should try out 535 since with v6, it might be a better drive for the bigger car, but again due to price shock did not even try it.So now I am back to Lexus ES 350.With what I have learned from this forum, now I am interested in trying the Avalon (limited).  It come out about 2K less that lexus and also has wider backseat.  So want to try it and see how it feels.Another thing I have started to think about is to lease a MB.

For example, non-existent boat that ""could"" be pulled by the vehicle (that's why ""need"" for a big truck based SUV, or mother-in-law visiting town once a year being a reason to get seven passenger vehicle).  In other words, the air is as comfortable in 328 than as in Avalon."

Since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as critical, but improved access maj just do the trick.   And you get extra cargo space for kids' stuff.

Yet, when I saw it on the platform in Munich and ever since, I thought it can't be better.  The only true downside of it, it is a dust magnet, especially in the back.  Just like black, if not more.

3002,m6user,"April 9, 2013 7:32AM","I think you should look at the Acura TL.  It's front wheel drive like the Lexus, gets excellent MPG, rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long time(which you indicated).  The German cars will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles.  If you have to deal with snow the Lexus and TL being FWD will be a little better for traction.  The Acura TL also comes in a AWD version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling I wouldn't recommend it as it is heavier, get less MPG and cost several thousand more.  Why pay for it if you're not really going to use it.  The Germans are all RWD with AWD being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the AWD which, again, raises the price and lowers the MPG.If it were me and I had the same buying criteria that you have, I would go with either the Lexus or the Acura."

3014,dino001,"April 10, 2013 8:47AM","BTW, the last generation ES was a tart up Camry which was 10-15K less then a ES.Well, apples to apples? Top of the line Camry was just about entry for ES, except perhaps Nav, which I'm not sure if it was standard on ES then.  TOL Camry was/is over 30K, ES was starting at mid 30s. I think apples-to-apples, the ""brand"" difference, if you will, was more like 5 grand, no more.  And that bought you a few things, from superior upholstery, to better frame fabrication, to some more clever features standard on ES and not even available on Camry.  It's not just that ES interior looked better, it had more good stuff in it.  My coworker has one so I can see how much good stuff it had.  Not sure if Camry did, even at TOL.What would likely increase the price difference is amount of discount you could get on Camry vs. ES then.  It's probably similar on Avalon/ES today, but I don't know that for sure, as this is part of the market unknown to me."

Diesel almost never falls below regular, most of the time it stays either above or just below premium gasoline per gallon, probably more often above by 10-20 cents.  It is not available at my Costco station, where I fuel every week (i.e. the effective differential is even higher, as Costco charges less than say Shell or BP).  Considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance, the mpg differential needs to be really substantial to offset the fact that I don't like how it drives vs. nice smooth gas engine.

3038,leoblue,"April 2, 2013 5:22PM","Hello everyone, I'm new to this forum. I'm sorry in advance if my question has been discussed before (haven't been able to go through 15000 previous posts yet, but I will).And also sorry in advance to BMW 3series fans because what I'll write may sound like I'm trashing BMW. But in fact, on the opposite, I'm looking for your help to make the case that BMW 3 is still the right car for me.That's all for the opening, here's my story:I'm having an Acura TL2004 at 125K miles. I love this car, inside out. But recently, it's been having so many problems that I decided it's time for a new car. Actually, my TL has been having quite a few problems since the warranty expired but I kept fixing it hoping that problem would be last but it's not the case...Anyway, since I'm looking for a new car, BMW 3 series is on top of my list thanks to all what I read about how great it is... a benchmark for the performance segment....So I test drove a BMW 328i xdrive and a 328i 2013 model last week, and here's my first reaction:- Interior: far worse than my TL, materials look cheap and feel cheap. The seat leatherette looks like it's not fully stretched leaving ""waves"" here and there (hope you understand this, English is not my native language). The steering wheel stitches feel rough on the hands. For me, the best phrase to describe the cabin is ""made in China"" kind of stuff (just the feeling, not fact)- Performance: trying to overcome the disappointment with the interior, I was hoping that the German approach was no nonsense and put all the money into the driving experience. However, I felt only marginally better driving dynamic and that's only achieved with Sport mode because when I started with Eco mode, I could hardly tell the improvement vs. my TL. You may say that I'm not that sophisticated a driver to really feel the difference. But the fact is that when I drove a Toyota Camry and a Nissan Maxima just a few weeks ago (rental cars), I clearly felt the difference with the Camry and Maxima feeling like it's ""floating"" on the road vs. my TL's my firmer, controlled and composed dynamic. Driving 80mph in the Camry and Maxima I didn't feel as secured as in my TL. I was hoping for that ""leap"" from the TL to the BMW 3 but it was not the case.Long story, hope I didn't bother you too much. Here are my questions:- Have someone owned both Acura TL (04-08 model) and BMW 3 series? What's your opinion about the 2 cars?- Could my limited excitement be due to the fact that the test drive was to short to really feel the difference (I was on each car (328i and 328i xdrive) for about 20 mins)? Or could it be because the TL is really good and all that driving performance superiority of BMW 3 was compared to the mainstream car like Camry so I didn't feel that much of a jump?I still really want BMW 328 to be my next car and I hope you could help me to really understand the difference.Thank you very much."
3039,dino001,"April 2, 2013 6:13PM","One thing is BMW has many options and lines.   I would not even touch leatherette interior.  The wood or sport line inlays look so much better than standard silver, it's not even funny.  Sport and M lines have much better seats.  I understand there is also different suspension on M line, not sure about sports.  If you option it right, not just get some base level from the dealer's lot, the car will be different.  The only true downside is the price.  To get ""right"" BMW, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price.  Worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers.  I looked my dealer's and it seems majority are basic, one two options, not even those designer lines, which trully add nice touches, for a price of course.  Bottom line, if you aren't ready to pay up, you better go with Acura.  The price is simply better, especially if you want to stay well below 50 grand."
3040,dino001,"March 23, 2013 5:04AM","All standard leases include GAP coverage.  Putting money down on a lease is a bad idea, period.  It is usually based on desire to lower payment and projecting what one should do on a loan, where large downpayment is actually a good idea.  The difference is in completely different type of risk in each of those financing schemes.  Loan puts risk of ownership on the buyer, lease puts it on the bank.  So banks will love people putting money down on a lease."

3053,dino001,"March 25, 2013 5:31AM","I second that.  I'm not objecting to people buying/leasing cars often, I actually have done that, too.  I'm definintely not a 10-year holder of a purchased 3-year old car, the longest stint I have done so far was 6 years, I also owned another car until it was 8 years old (I had it for a bit more than 4 years).It is wonderful that system made it possible and convenient for somebody to drive a virtually new car all the time (and a nice one) and move from one to another in a seamless fashion, without big hassles.  It is also true that some manufacturers subsidize those lease deals,  which is effectively lowering their sticker prices without actually doing so.  Even with all of that, constantly paying a portion of three years of depreciation (even if it is lowered by a subsidy) is more expensive than buying a car (cash or loan) and say staying just couple of years beyond the warranty expiration.  The sweet spot would be eight to ten years, but even six would do for most of the situations, except extreme ones.  Many say ""you can't own a car beyond warranty, it will fall apart and cost you a fortune"" I say there is no evidence of such and let an extended warranty pricing be a guide.  Since that is a very profitable product (number of people get fed by just selling them), and 100K mile extension with small deductible on ELLPS will not exceed $4K (most likely it will be about three grand)  adding that plus extra planned maintenance of about another 2-3 grand (also most likely less), gives us AT MOST 7 grand average price of extended ownership.  In fact, majority of people will pay much less, some unlucky ones will pay more.  Nobody will convince me that two times  (even) subsidized three year depreciation plus interest (money factor) and fees (two acquisition fees - $1500, two disposal fees - $500-$1000) is less that one time 6-year unsubsidized depreciation plus interest, but no fees plus extra maintenance and repairs/ext. warranty.  And 6-years old well maintained car is still nice enough, IMHO.The only time the lease thing MAY be a trully cheaper alternative, is when the car is simply not driven by the leasee/owner, or to be more precise, when it is one of those (sorry Nurse and Doggy) ""leader ad"" deal, when the mileage limit is something like 8-10K per year.  That will change the math in lease's favor, even with fees.  However, for a normal commuter living in places like mine (no real public transit, 15-20 mile one-way just to get to work), the three year lease, even heavily subsidized, is a much more expensive proposition vs. extended ownership.   It offers a convenience to those who will not be able to stay with their three-year old car, but even then it can be a tossup.  Hwere is an example: in late 2008 I bought the STI, which I sold in early 2012 (3 years and change).  In November of 2008, Lehman Brothers just went bankrupt, nobody was buying anything, Subaru offered $2500 off price that was already 2% under invoice PLUS 0% APR financing for 63 months.  Basically $36.5K (plus fees, TTR, roughly $40K total) sticker became $29K ($33 with all taxes and fees).  Three years later I sold it for $22.8K, 69% of total transaction price.  It just so happened that the Japanese earthquake choked the new car supply to the point that used ones had prices beyond ridiculous. The lease offered at the time of purchase was at somewhere around 50% residual, i.e. $18 grand (not subsidized, and MF and all fees were definitely NOT zero).  It was just a fluke, but even if I sold/traded the STI at originally projected value of $18K, the lease MF and fees would still be far more than the financing of the loan.  At that time I investigated the lease becuase I did not consider STI to be my long-term choice anyway, but even with that the purchase showed to be much better course of action."

Pretty high starting price ($42.4K including destination.  BTW, what's up with their stupid ""starting at"" with a price without destination?  How can I get one without destination? Don't you hate it when they start off with a blatant lie?).However, I'm sure when you price sedan to match wagons standard features  (all wheel drive, fold down rear seat, sunroof), the differential is about 2 grand. I understand one may or may not want those, especially x-drive, but it's only fair to add to make apples to apples comparison.  In ""Dino's minimum config"", i.e. red metallic, premium and lighting packages, anti-theft system, sport trim, including upgraded seats, sport transmission package (apples to apples), the price differential is about 2 grand ($49.6K wagon, $47.7K sedan).  Steep, if you ask me for a (nice, admittedly) turbocharged four cylinder engine.  Nice car, but no thanks for now - I stay with my E91, which cost me a few good thousands less, has extra navigation, a few more conveniences, including keyless entry, shades, homelink, parking sensors, basically another several grand of options on top of what's already high price.  I can only imagine the price for 335i GT, when it comes in.  I probably will have to wait even longer, if I wanted one.I also noticed they finally made split rear folddown seat standard on 328/335. Interestingly enough, 320i does not have it standard.  Talking about leader ad there...  They really make it so they can advertise ""starting at"" with $299/month, or maybe even $259/m lease if you don't want leather.  After loading with leather and stuff, it tops 40 thousand bucks, 45 if you really put ""everything"" on it, but not by whole lot, so there is real price separation with loaded 328i.  To me, it is pointless,  but I guess for those looking at white an blue propeller in front and nice handling, but not much more, they get something there.  It may be even selling OK."

3063,flightnurse,"March 28, 2013 8:22AM","Dino, when it comes to gas prices, talk about difference in prices. In Calif Diesel is less then Premium unleaded, and with the 30% increase in MPG of diesel over gas, people who understand this will buy them. In Phoenix, currently Diesel is less then regular unleaded, so this means the price difference between Diesel and Premium unleaded is roughly .35/gal.  Now will this stay this way, who knows, but as long as Diesel's price does not exceed premium unleaded by 30% there is a savings. What is the average price of Premium unleaded (PU) and diesel in the tampa area? How much does it cost to fill the tank with  PU and how much would it cost to fill with with the same amount of gallons with Diesel? I'm sure the difference isn't that much but the savings on the diesel would out weight  the cost."
3064,dino001,"March 5, 2013 3:36PM","Yeah, I had same thoughts.  The comment on synthetic simply didn't add up to me either.  Knowing that European brands/models and all other brands marketed across the Pond (that includes GM, Ford, Honda et al.) come with synthetic-only maintenance with intervals 12-20 thousand miles, depending on the brand (they did that about a bit less than 10 years ago).  You have to use specific brand (or approved brands), or you void your warranty, but the idea is to cut into number of visits in garages.  Seems it didn't catch up in the US because the dealers would rather see you four times per year, so they can always find something to do.  In exchange, you get cheapest oil they can buy, but since you change it every three months, it doesn't matter that much (in their mind anyway).  It would be an outrage if customers suddenly stopped coming just because the oil got better and doesn't need to be changed, wouldn't it?  Not in this country, we don't allow things like that.Plekto's short synthetic life comment make no sense to me.  Even oil companies today sell full syntetic oil with indicated intervals on the box north of 10 thousand miles.  They woudn't do that, if the product didn't meet that.  They have interest in selling more stuff, not less.The advantage of synthetics is supposed oil particle size and chemistry, which in turn is supposed to provide both better lubrication and lifespan."
3065,sweendogy,"March 5, 2013 5:21PM","Oil commentary from edmunds- yes edmundshttp://www.edmunds.com/car-care/top-7-urban-legends-about-motor-oil.htmlMy favorite line is ""Synthetic oil is better for your car's engine and it improves your fuel economy. Myth""For those of you who are leasing- and put synthetic in the car even though its not mandated I would think 2x before spending the extra coin on a car you don't own- for those of you who get the ""free"" BMW oil changes who cares on the 3 changes you will need.I own my car - I do 2 oil changes a year and use a synthetic blend- no real reason why I choose it - it's cheaper then full synthetic and cost 10 bux more a change vs the regular and it makes me feel good for some odd reason-"
3066,plekto,"March 5, 2013 11:28PM","Are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? I thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, I assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils.No, it doesn't have a shorter life span.  It's more than double, in fact.  The issue is what happens when both are put under stress or are reaching the end of their lifespans.Synthetic oil is slippery goo that is only protecting the engine's internals due to the anti-wear additives that are part of it.  When those run out, the goo essentially has the protection of water, or close to it.   If you are near the end of its life and, say, it's a cold winter day, the synthetic has all gone down into the crankcase other than a thin film left on the internal parts.  If the levels of anti-wear additives are too low, you're in trouble as there is nothing to fall back on.Natural oil has anti-wear additives as well(to help with higher rpms and pressures), but when it reaches the end of its life, the oil itself retains a fair amount of low rpm/starting anti-wear properties as long as it hasn't suffered thermal breakdown.(synthetic oils are better in this regard)  In fact, oil will retain most of this natural level of protection even when it has been reduced to sludge.The reason you should run semi-synthetic, as GM is now recommending, though not openly (new Dexos standard), is because when the synthetic runs close to the end of its lifespan, there is something to fall back on.  Semi-synthetic works for pretty much all engines and is incredibly resistant to abuse as well.  That it's cheaper is also a huge plus.And, yes, almost all other manufacturers have their oil life sensors tweaked to be very sensitive with a massive safety margin if the car is running on pure synthetic.  You'll never have an issue with a Honda because the synthetic isn't even halfway to its real end of life. (use it in a lawnmower or whatever if you drain it yourself - it'll still work for that just fine, even used)"
3067,plekto,"March 6, 2013 10:06AM","And... nothing in that article is counter to what I was saying.   :P#1 is about 3K oil changes.  This is of course, about *oil*, which has a certain amount of natural lubrication ability no matter how old it gets.  I use conventional oil in my ""commuter"" car (It's almost 15 years old now) and routinely run 4 or 5 thousand miles in it with no problems.   My Dad's CTS is showing that it's time to change it at about 5-7 months, typically, which correlates with what the service center mechanics now recommend.Not a huge difference, well, other than price.... I sometimes get the feeling that we're getting scammed into buying new technology.#2 - #5 are common sense, IMO.#6 is absolutely correct in that you can swap right over to semi-synthetic for the extra level of protection that it affords if you forget to change the oil.  Semi-synthetic is awesome stuff, IMO, that gives you the best of both worlds for hardly any more money.#7 also was touched on in my post, though indirectly.  Conventional oil is not inferior to synthetic oils in normal driving conditions.  The video that the article links to on this assumes that synthetic is always superior other than price, though.  Most of the press also assumes this.   Nearly every claim about synthetic oil being superior is based upon racing or extreme conditions, as well, where it does make a difference.If you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ RPMs), there might be some added protection.  But it's going to make no difference in your Jeep or Civic.http://autos.aol.com/article/gm-engine-oil/""Further, GM says that if a customer has an engine failure that is traced to oil or lubrication issues, and if the customer does not use dexos 1 oil in their gasoline-powered GM vehicle, that act alone could void the warranty.""Note - Cadillac originally mandated Mobil 1 full synthetic in the CTS.    That they would change from full to a blend and make it mandatory is telling."
3068,plekto,"March 6, 2013 11:12AM","Obviously.  This also affected Porsche, Mazda (RX-8), the Honda S2000, and several other cars with high revving engines.  Conventional oils simply couldn't take the punishment.    And as engines get to be smaller and higher revving, with more turbos in the mix, you'd need a synthetic blend as a minimum.Look, synthetics are superior to conventional oils in every way but one.  The base stock of both oils is not the same.  While the synthetic has vastly superior properties in most aspects, it's also so highly refined that it provides little protection by itself (almost watery with no viscosity).   Conventional oil does to a degree.  Then they add the additives to it to make it the oil you and I buy.  This isn't an issue at all until you get to a scenario where the oil gets too old.In essence, there is no failure mode for synthetics.  They work perfectly until they don't and the engine blows up.  So ""whatever, I'll change it in another month"" simply is asking for trouble over time.  Conventional oils just sludge up and while that's a huge separate problem, your bottom end bearings usually won't grind themselves into oblivion."

Now nobody but the actual person knows what their financial situation is so really we have no business deciding what they should be doing with their money ( as I stated in the my original reply) and the payments on the BMW may be about the same as on the civic ( though with a bigger upfront payment) so why not go for it if you can and want to, but in general it make more sense to have fewer and lower payments to get yourself out of debt before you go adding new debt, of course I agree with the size of many peoples student debt they can't put their lives on hold for twenty years, but a lot of people seem to want it all as soon as they graduate and get into further financial difficulties, I guess all I am saying is they have to make sure they can actually afford what they buy, and that they have to be aware that just because you get a job as a fresh graduate doesn't mean they are going to still have that job in a year or two ( in today's workplace there are very few guarantees) and that they also need to budget savings so they can afford to survive and continue to pay for things in the event they do lose that great first job.

Sometimes, depending on inventory or market trends you can actually buy the luxury brand for almost the same price.  Case in point was when my wife wanted a SUV and she had decided on a Pathfinder.  I knew the QX4 was virtually the same thing but much nicer outfitted and was going away.  We made a killer deal on the QX4 that was actually less than we could have bought the Pathfinder for.I'm sure there are plenty of people that look at loaded Camrys versus ES, or Accord vs. TSX or even TL, or Fusion vs MKZ.

The wide and low profile tires that were on the Audi and on this Acura can be the source of some ride stiffness, but I have no issues that I can comment on that have anything to do with the electric power steering.The TL SH-AWD Advance is very well equipped, smooth driving and riding, yet agile and nimble (due to the wheel/tire combo and the sport suspension).It does seem to be not an unreasonable imitation of an Audi S4 when one factors in the S4's $11,000 premium when similarly contented -- if you can get past the controversial styling (yes, even the toned down 2012 still has too much ""beak"" for most folks.)I will shop Acura (among others) for my next car when the lease is up on this one -- at this point, I would shop the upcoming TLX, the Infiniti Q50, the Audi A4, the BMW 3, the Cadillac ATS and CTS and probably the Volvo S60.The Acura suffers from NOT providing its owner with an experience that is not crystal-clearly differentiated from the Honda upon which it is based.Some people think that Acura's best feature is that it comes from the Honda Motors Corporation.

Mostly that was true, but not always.  Several people posted who seemed credible and checked their oil on a regular basis.  At some point the engine started using a quart of oil every few hundred miles, and that was a disaster for the average ""set it and forget it"" driver who wouldn't know how to check or add oil to save their souls.The 3.6 engine has serious issues, possibly related to the cam drive system, but in any event the symptom is sudden onset high oil consumption followed by engine failure.  Too many people have outlined the same scenario for it to be made up and/or anecdotal isolated incidents."

3112,plekto,"March 5, 2013 2:13PM","When the oil life percentage in my Explorer gets to 0%, Ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. That indicator has a level of safety built in.Evidently, in the CTS's case, 0 life was really very close to 0% and there was no leeway.   GM changed it to be twice as sensitive (2011) so it tells you it's time in about 6 months or 6000 miles, which gives you a fair amount of leeway.   Note - anything less than about 25% protection is running into greatly increased wear with synthetic oils.  If you are running an older (2011 or older, evidently) CTS, letting it drop below 50% oil life remaining is causing increased wear and problems.I ran into this a few years ago when I was looking for a car for my parents.  And back then the mechanics at the dealers were all saying to get it changed at 6 months/6K miles. (the manual says almost twice that interval) That they didn't do a recall is a whole other problem, but the mechanics certainly figured out what had happened with the oil life sensors several years ago.So the engine isn't the issue.  In fact, it's the best engine GM has ever built.  It, not too surprisingly, wasn't really designed to run on synthetic goo which some marketing genius managed to pass off as ""oil"".  GM kind of found this out the hard way, it seems.NOTE - there is nothing that says that you can't run semi-synthetic in the car, either.  In fact, the newer oil that they put in it at the dealership when you get it changed (on 2011+ models at least) is actually semi-synthetic.  GM doesn't want to admit that their engines shouldn't be run on pure synthetic and are ""suggesting"" their new DEXOS standard oils.Yes, it's buried way way in the fine print, but DEXOS is semi-syntietic oil under a new brand name/standard to try to confuse the issue, since they spent over a decade ruthlessly pounding into everyone's head that pure synthetic oils were better than conventional ones.(which is not true, obviously)So the fix?   Switch to semi-synthetic ASAP.  Change oil every 6K miles/6 months.  Ignore the computers and change the oil religiously at those intervals.  Semi-synthetic costs about twice as much per change, but you change it half as often."
3113,sweendogy,"February 8, 2013 6:19AM",Talking about pricing and packaging - most chatter I've ever seen about this rig on these channels- no one is talking about what you really get with this 37k MB- a weak engine and sub group performance - I guess you do get the keys with the star on it - you get to walk into a dealership with 100k cars around.  I still can't wrap my head around German premium car companies charging for leather on any car.
3114,graphicguy,"February 8, 2013 6:44AM","dino....I always seem to look at Benzes when I'm in the market.  That's about as far as I get given they really aren't all that sporty of a drive (until you get into the really high buck AMG versions).  And, I try to understand the allure of them.Perhaps I'm only looking at the ""run of the mill"" MBs like the Cs and Es.  I just can't make that leap.  They aren't built any better than a comparable Audi or BMW.  They certainly don't perform better than either of those.  And, these days, not even the Japanese can claim tech or reliability superiority over Audi or BMW.For the same, usually less money, you can get something that's better, in most ways, from BMW or Audi.I'll have to assume that pushing the Mercedes marque down the ladder with the CLA is taking a page out of GM's marketing book.  ""Hook them on a low priced Chevy (in Mercedes' case, a CLA), and move them up the model ladder"".That Mercedes Star, at that price point, is going to open up their market to  perhaps one that they wouldn't necessarily want.Hope to see the CLA at the auto shows.  At least on my computer monitor, it looks pretty slick.  But, so does a BMW 1 series or an A3, its competition."
3115,graphicguy,"February 8, 2013 10:55AM",FN.....good point.  I guess the lux marks see gold to be mined where Accords and Camry sometimes play.
3116,flightnurse,"February 11, 2013 11:29PM","This is a great question, so would you buy a Acura ILX or a fully loaded Camry?"
3117,graphicguy,"February 12, 2013 4:35AM","FN.....I can't even remember the last time I drove a Camry....at least 2-3 generations ago.  And, I've never driven an ILX.  So, not sure if I can answer your question.Would I look at them?  Sure!  But, as most of us here are, I'm a car fanatic.  I'm interested in all cars.Generally speaking, the customer for a Camry probably wouldn't consider any Mercedes for no other reason than they think maintenance and repairs are too costly and frequent.  That perception can be debated.  But, perception is reality in most people's minds.I know the 2 years I've owned my 335i, I haven't spent one nickel on maintenance due to BMW's 4 year ""no maintenance cost"" plan.  The GF got a 4 year maintenance plan for the S4 where everything is covered. That was extra cost, and I can't remember what it was. When she asked me about it, it seemed reasonable at the time so it wasn't anything extraordinary.I've had the BMW in once for warranty work.  The driver's leather seat had an area that was discoloring.  They didn't re-dye it.  They actually replaced the entire seat cover.  Aside from oil changes and I think a software update they did for IDrive the last time I had the oil changed, that's been in.The GF's S4 has only had an oil change and tire rotation.  That's it.Will a Camry be the same?  They have a reputation as being trouble free.  But, it sure seems like I read about a whole lot more recalls the last couple of years regarding Toyotas, than I hear from Benz, Audi, BMW or Acura.I don't pay much attention to Lexus or Infiniti.  So, I don't know if an inordinate amount of recalls extend to those brands or not.I see the CLA's customer as being a young (20s) person not really looking for performance.  But, one who's looking for an entre into the German marks and the alleged status they bring to the table (whether that status is real, or imagined).For a little bit more than a Camry, they can have a Mercedes, regardless of whether a CLA is or is not the better performing car.Something tells me you're going to see dealers back load those cars with the crazy wheels, spoilers, etc that make most of us cringe.  But, that's the type of customer the CLA will appeal to.  Dealers better get ready for a whole new type of tire kickers entering their showrooms once the CLA is released.Personally, I like the looks of the CLA.  That might change when I see one in person.  But, given that I put a higher priority on overall performance with my lux, I doubt I'll consider a CLA as something that would sit in my garage.I'm betting a Camry SE with a V6 will out handle and out accelerate a CLA.  Yet, they won't be cross shopped by that same 20 something."

3126,markcincinnati,"February 15, 2013 11:48AM","I read the test report, today in USATODAY on-line, of the new Acura RLX.  The price came in at $61,000.  The thing is, this was a front-wheel-drive version and it was noted that the AWD version wouldn't be here 'til fall and that the way the thing got to AWD would be by the addition of two electric motors one each driving a rear wheel.  Comment was that this would add complexity and cost (and a heavy battery pack.)The car is probably every bit as nice to drive as Healy says it is, but for $61K you can get a very well equipped Audi A6 or BMW 5 (both of them AWD variants.) The Acura isn't ugly, it's just boring looking, too.What were they thinking?What will drift down to the new TLX (or whatever it is called)?  Will the TL at least retain the availability of SH-AWD (I think only AWD TL's should be offered -- to really be in the ELLPS class)?To my eye a top o' the line Passat looks more ""premium"" than the RLX (and the current TL -- and I know, I have one.)What makes something belong to a certain class -- it seems the lines have become blurred somewhat. There is no way I would put this new RLX in the LPS class, despite a $61K MSRP (as tested.)I thought too that Lincoln was having a case of wishful thinking when they wouldn't allow their new baby to be tested against an Avalon -- since the Lincoln folks clearly didn't want to see their new Lincoln Motorcar hanging out with the riff raff.And, I do agree with a previous poster, that the Genesis certainly seems to pass the smell test insofar as it being able to pass as a premium or at least entry-level-premium, if such a thing exists.I mentioned my airline pilot friend -- a long time BMW owner/driver -- got a Genesis R Spec hot on the heels of owning a BMW 5, and he loves it. He probably doesn't count though since he usually just goes from his house to the airport long term parking and back.  A 5 series probably was overkill for his twice weekly commute.In any case, I started out wondering who in the wide-wide-world of sports would pay $61K for a front-wheel-drive Acura.

Yeah, I think this is a disapointment that Germans charge extra for those. It should be standard today on ELLPS.Leather seats?  I'd agree that in US-market it is also a big disapointment that BMW or Benz demand almost two grand for that, but knowing a bit about Euro market, I can certify that Europeans at large do not revere leather uphostery nearly as much as Americans.  Many straight out prefer high quality cloth over leather on both their home couch and their car.  One could call it charitably a ""cultural difference"".  MB Tex is reporteadly a very high quality material, both in terms of appearance and durability, so it is even preferred by many.  Quick inventory browse shows it is a majority on C250 models, which seems to confirm that assertion.  If they sell, they can't be so bad.  I bet many people actually think it is leather (as it is faking it really well).I don't know about BMW, their leatherette has much less footprint.  It may mean the quality differential is greater.  However, BMW also bundles leather with its premium package (MB does not), which is considered a must, even by selling dealers (BMW dealers actually order the cars they want within model allotments), plus it was even a free upgrade when E9x was being phased out (I know it was $0 option on my 2012 wagon).Anyway, I remember, when I added sunroof and those fold-down seats to sedan, suddenly the wagon (where it was standard) was not more expensive, at all.  Tells me a lot about the mindset and market.  I guess it is their effort to expand the buyer's base to those ""aspirational"" purchasers (not just by leases, but also by playing with content level), whereas wagons, coupes and convertibles do not have to carry that burden."

3151,sweendogy,"February 5, 2013 3:33PM",So msrps on Germans are misleading because you dk what exactly is in the said car. Interesting. I just went to the acura website- and they have 5 different ilx models - they come as they come no real options to speak just dealer accessories - same with the TL (6) and Tsx(5). Btw if the new mb 1 series is Ellps then so is the ilx.Now I'm not an acura fan in its current state of bland but will say if they are Ellps ( and to me that's debatable) they have pricing and packaging down.

I really want an AWD, so the S4 is my first choice. I heard the Quattro is sick. The car will mostly be used for Road trips and Weekend driving. I have a older Nissan Maxima that is my daily driver. My main issue with the Audi is that most people state that it will be costly and frequent, in the future, and I plan on keeping the car for a long time. My 96 Maxima currently has 171k on it.I live in San Antonio Tx and it can get pretty hot. Are there any reasons I should avoid the Audi besides costly repairs??? I am not a wrencher, but I am not afraid to dig in.I am open to other cars tooPlease give me suggestions!!!So far the cars that caught my eyes are:Infiniti G37x (looks cheap in most areas, but still a great ride)Lexus GS350 (Never owned a Toyota and this one seems pretty nice)Audi B8 S4 (so far has all the specs I want and I like to have cars I don't see on the road all the time)***BMW 335xi is not on my radar because I see way too many BMW's out here.

3154,dino001,"February 6, 2013 2:13PM","I don't know.  All I saw on the website, if you took least expensive C250 starting at $35350, but not really because there is non-optional $905 manufacturer's ""transportation charge"", i.e. it REALLY starts at $36,255 MSRP (that is case of deceptive advertising, but it's a different story).  Then any time you wanted to add leather, it required also a premium package, which in turn moved the price to 40+ grand.  Your quoted car seems C250 Sport Sedan ($36,580) with standard 5-twin spoke wheels (for that line) and $475 worth of options, which ain't much - perhaps it is some snap-on navigation they mention.  I do not think it is an internet There can be small discrepancies, as car prices change over the year.  Definitely no leather - MB Tex (high quality polymer) is standard seat surface.   No, this car does not have $2500 ""sports package"", it is C250 Sports Sedan.  There is a difference, but the dealer probably doesn't know it (or pretends not to know it).Edit:  Adding Sports Package to a red C250 Sports Sedan jacks the price to 41 grand (you have to add premium 1 with it, too, total bundle $4800).  I doubt dealer would advertise such car for 37 grand.  Considering the wheels, it is simple case of misinformation/misdirection."

I sold it earlier than I normally do as I was worried about more costs/problems. But it was never unreliable or left me stranded.I now have an Acura TL with 130K and pretty near nothing has gone wrong. It's more reliable and cheaper to own than the Audi, and a very nice car.Costs aside, I'd pick the Audi. Just be prepared for some extra $$, which you might not need, but you never know.

3157,graphicguy,"February 7, 2013 6:59AM","tlong.....you and I have the same taste in cars.....TLs, Audis, BMWs.Before the GF bought her S4, she did her due diligence.  Personally, if I like a car, I'm all over it.  But, I don't give much thought to reliability.  And, quite frankly, I don't put much stock in Consumer Reports reliability rankings, as I consider them little more than the CR faithful (who they base the reliability rankings on) as confirming foregone conclusions.  That's a different topic, though.The GF talked to everyone she knew who currently owned, or at some time owned an Audi in the past, about their ownership experience.  While not scientific, and probably only numbered a dozen people, without fail, Audi ownership experiences were positive.pletko....well smack me silly and call me foolish.  I like sport seats (that are heated).  I like trick DSG transmissions.  I like big fat leather steering wheels in my hands while driving. In other words, I'm one of those fools you describe.  I'm good with that.Had this discussion with a friend while at a SuperBowl party last Sunday.  He owns, among others, a BMW 6 series.  Nice car.  Not sure what the drivetrain is, but I think it's a V8 with a manumatic.  I've ridden in it several times.  I even drove it once (to take his inebriated butt home).  It definitely is big and heavy, and you feel the mass and weight.  It's not a particularly good handling machine, and it's not particularly quick.  It's what I consider a poseur.  That said, it's pretty and it costs a lot.  Both of those traits fit my my friend's personality to a tee. :PWe had the GF's S4 at the party.  As we got into discussions about cars, he found the S4 not ""blingy"" enough for his taste.  That alone made the S4's status move a couple of rungs up the status ladder for us.As we were talking, he asked me what I did not like about the TL.  In all reality, I couldn't list one thing.  There were some niggly things that maybe would bother me more than others (like a hint of torque steer on quick starts from stop).  But, nothing that was a show stopper.  Granted, the S4 and my 335 are faster and handle better.  Plus, the suspension/ride/handling compromise in the Germans and 2nd to none.But, the TL SH AWD will get you to 80% of what the Audi will do. There are some things that the TL does that no other car I've ever owned was able to do.  Now, these are minor things, but noticeable nonetheless.For example, I've never owned another car that had more comfortable sport seats than the TL.  Nothing is perfect.  But, for me, the TL's sport seats were about as close as you can get.  They're bolstered perfectly and are comfortable while holding you in your seat.The HVAC system heats up and cools down faster than in any other car I've ever owned, too.  And, it holds the perfect temp (that I've set) better than any other car I've owned.Ergonomically, at least for things like window switches, seat belt, steering wheel, etc., I could get in the TL, and with one smooth move reach and click the seat belt without reaching....all the while having my hand fall in the perfect location to the start button.Up until the B&O system in the S4 (which is insanely good), the TL's stereo was the best I had ever heard in a car (that includes some high buck aftermarket installations).Point of all this, even designs that are long in the tooth, like the TL, are still really good ELLPS these days.  And, I certainly don't feel foolish for liking the options they come with."
3158,flightnurse,"February 7, 2013 7:50AM","Dino I think we are getting away from the original post that you stated, to something about not being able to find a base model on the lot. The price of $37,055 is really a base model with one thing added which is a aftermarket nav system, that integrates with the radio, just like the OEM nav system. It's a pretty slick system, so with the base price + shipping the car is $36,255, then add the nav system $800, this is how you get the $37,055 price.  So it is possible to get a base C250, and the dealer I posted has many of them."

3161,flightnurse,"February 7, 2013 9:39PM","You are correct and I'm sorry, it was Billperksii who wrote that no one would find a base car on the lot.."
3162,dino001,"February 8, 2013 5:02AM","Understood.  If anything, I see the similar trend in stock of my local dealership.  Vast majority of C250s they have there are low-option level between 37 and 40 grand MSRP.  Moreover, there is very little stock of C300 or C350 lines. If you are an options fool (like I am), you would actually have a hard time to find C250 with the goodies. Very few cars with leather (MBTex seems to rule there), sports pack, some have premium pack, but unlike BMW, Benz charges for leather on top of premium pack.I woulnd't buy one anyway, but it is interesting to see what dealers think sells.  It appears to me that BMW dealers tend to have better variety of options (from strippers to fully optioned), perhaps not at all times, but it is easier to find content level (and price) closer to anyone's preference (except for manual transmissions - those were non-existent in Tampa Bay last time I checked), which means they anticipate customers for every level of content, whereas Benz dealers seem to think people want the the star on the hood, but don't really care for the extras.  But as I wrote in the past, there are some particular practices on both lots that are beyond me (like those fold-down seats on 3-series sedans, available as stand alone or part of cold weather pack and since Florida cars don't need cold pack, almost none of the ordered sedans get fold-down seats  :mad: )."

Let's say the 320i leases at $349.  Then it gives BMW the room to move the 328i to $399 a month while still offering the frugal buyers the 320i for $50 a month less."

3169,dino001,"January 18, 2013 5:36AM","Sween, I'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing).  Everything is getting more expensive. Loaded Ford Focus is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker, same goes for many other compacts, loaded Accord crosses 30 grand in a snap, Lexus raised the sticker for its hatchback hybrid by three grand or so without clear increase in its content (don't know too much about this vehicle to say, but saw a headline), so why wouldn't BMW want to charge 40+ grand for its detuned entry level 3-series with couple of options?  I bet Infinity will soon come up dreadful with G25 replacement, which will be opportunity to ""reset"" pricing for it and G37.  Even Acura with its traditional value approach, made a move down, but mostly by rebadging and redressing Civic, which I would hardly call an attractive ELLPS. However, ILX is an opportunity to move prices on next TSX up (provided they will they keep the car, I sure hope so).Everything is getting more expensive.  We all have to deal with it.

3171,habitat1,"January 18, 2013 9:42AM","Flight,You conveniently avoided my previous post with an excerpt from Dinan's own website that forewarned that, essentially, there is no free lunch and ""reflashing"" will result in greater engine stress and wear.  Go back to my previous post for the direct quote or read through their homepage.And Dinan's willingness to match BMW's 4/50 engine warranty is not much consolation when modern engines should easily last 150k+ miles.  Hell, I could probably do fine over the next month or two having a 5 hour energy drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  But I don't think that would be a wise long term solution to just eating right and getting exercise.I don't know the percentage of daily driving 3-series buyers that go to their local Dinan store for a pick me up to try to turn their 328's into 335's and their 335's into M3's.  But my guess is the percentage can be counted using less than the fingers on one hand - and a thumb isn't a finger.  I do know that the resale value of an everyday BMW that has had the ""reflash"" or other engine modifications is significantly reduced.  And I suspect that it's not permitted in a lease.  It certainly will never qualify for a BMW CPO warranty.So the idea of reflashing a 320 might be an option for you and a handful of your buddies, but that's really not comparing factory apples to factory apples for 96%+ of the market.  Maybe 99%."

I passed up on the 2002s, 320is and the wonderful E90s until one fine day I stopped in at a BMW reseller near my office and priced second-hand E39s.I ended up getting a 4 y/o  2000 328ia for about half the original MSRP.  I've put 100,000 miles on it in the eight years since and it still looks and runs great. That strategy was so successful that I decided last winter to get a 2001 330Ci Cabrio to serve as my winter ride while I'm in Arizona for the cold months.  This particular car had just under 80K on it and cost about what a new Focus would. It has given me no problems at all thus far.BMWs have a pretty steep depreciation curve.

3185,markcincinnati,"January 29, 2013 12:30PM","Well I would agree that there are no test reports pertaining to the Q50 -- or if there are, I can't find them or don't have the time to look.But I thought the specs were revealed.  I know that I printed out the current G dimensions (wheel base, overall length and width, etc.)  Also somewhere there is a discussion of the two engines the thing will offer on day one -- including HP and torque.My admittedly fuzzy recollection: Q50, same wheelbase as G37; Q50, 2"" wider than G, Q50 about 2"" longer than Q. Same 7 speed transmission in the Q50 as was in the G37 -- and that is the only transmission offered. Same 3.7L engine in the Q50 as was/is in the G; the hybrid uses a 3.5L engine -- similar to the set up in the M37 and the M hybrid.Q50 can be had in both engine variants with AWD.Now, insofar as the full run down of specs (like can be found about the G37), I have not been able to find a source for these specs pertaining to the Q50.Overall, the new Q50 will be longer and wider and probably ""feel"" like a major size upgrade over the G37's.I assume the Q50 will be a slightly smaller, more agile, quicker version of the M37 -- or a slightly larger, more agile, quicker version of the G37.I am looking forward to driving one -- hopefully the sport package includes beefier springs, struts/shocks, anti-sway bars and brakes, in addition to sport seats and a steering wheel with paddle shifters.I see no big deal in the dropping of a manual transmission. The up take on manual transmission versions was probably less than 3 or 4% in any case. My assumption is Infiniti let the stick shifts go due to market apathy.I would expect a small price increase -- real, but not huge (not yet anyway.)"
3186,flightnurse,"January 29, 2013 1:32PM","Dinio I would agree that the Q50 is going to be higher in price, and that a smaller car will be placed under the Q50. Something like 1 series or A3. Now in regards to pricing of the 320i, a fully loaded 320i is $46K, Nav is a stand- alone option on the car, I would guess that most people would go for a 320i with Premium package, and Nav, which is 40K.

3187,markcincinnati,"January 29, 2013 2:20PM","Priced MUCH HIGHER?I would think if, to use made up but approximate numbers, that an Audi A4 or BMW 3 (something) can be ""nicely contented,"" which I suspect means, these days, Premium Package, Premium Paint (and Infiniti doesn't, currently, charge for any color they offer), Nav Package, and Sport Package or Technology Package (but not both) for something between $45K and $49K -- depending on the ""either or"" packages and metallic paint, bla bla bla, that Infiniti would be -- even with this new presumably sexy Q50 -- hard pressed to come in at parity with the Germans.I mean, really, my last A4 (a 2009) was $49K -- for $49K I'm going to stick with the German car.  I wouldn't pay $49K for the G (or the new Q -- at least not until it is vetted by you all here on Edmunds and the motoring press, etc.)I would think the Q50 will have to be very nicely equipped (meaning all the bells and whistles Infiniti can offer -- but not the hybrid version) and a few grand less to win, to conquer the pro German buyers.I leased my current Acura TL SH-AWD Advance ONLY because it was much less than a 2012 A4 comparably equipped and a hell of a lot less than an S4 which the TL somewhat ""imitiates.""I'll scope out a new A4, BMW and probably C class.  Then I will do my best ""objective"" comparison with and without a consideration of price.If the Q50 turns out to be BMW-like and is hundreds less per month in payments or thousands less in MSRP (and/or street price) and is either contented at or greater than the BMW, I'll very probably give the Q50 serious consideration.If the Q50 is close to the ""cost"" of the German rivals -- with even somewhat close content, the German is with very high certainty going to be the chosen one.I could be wrong -- but, not uncertain, of course -- and perhaps the new ex-Audi alum, Infiniti CEO will want to pump up the Q50's MSRP to achieve parity with the German ""B"" segment from the get-go.My logic, hopefully not specious, is that the Infiniti Q50 no matter how much it is called the Japanese BMW will not be able to command BMW prices until such time -- if ever -- that people start calling the BMW, ""the German Infiniti."":surprise:   DOH!Homer"
3188,dino001,"January 11, 2013 10:20AM","During my family visit in the Old Country this Xmas, I drove my dad's Audi A4 1.9TDI (2005, I think).Would never switch my 328i for it (or previous WRX/STI, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years.  The clacking sound is still something to get used to.  I appreciate better fuel economy and torque, but everything else is better on a good gasoline engine: sound (as for pleasure of well-running engine), noise level, vibrations, weight.  Yes, the torque is higher on diesel, but it lasts for 1000 rpm and then it's gone - and when it's gone and you forget to shift, you get run over.  May not be such a problem for those new 7-, 8- speed automatic transmissions, but my dad's A4 had 6-speed manual.   I love manual transmissions, but not on diesels, apparently - you end up shifting back and forth, always caught on wrong gear (car stops accelerating after the torque peak in merging/passing, or it starts vibrating when left on too high gear for current speed - often issue in city driving).No, diesels are not such a pleasure as some may like you believe.

I didn't find the torque disappearing and remember driving around lake Garda and the curvy roads enjoying the scenery and shifting through the gears.   Freeways were also worry free.  I remember being passed by a Smart on the freeway at about 150 klicks and saying ""holy crap, I wouldn't go that fast in that thing!""Point is, I think it depends on the particular diesel engine.  I also believe I would try at a least a couple of modern diesels with 7-8 spd auto trannies before I made a blanket statement that all diesels belong in semis or farm tractors."
3190,dino001,"January 11, 2013 12:32PM","Perhaps you're right, but VAG's 1.9TDI (previous gen 4-cylinder diesel) was a highly acclaimed motor, a special favorite in high-mileage used car markets, like my Old Country's (Poland).  My dad's is abot 100k miles, which is nothing for those engines.  Granted, that engine is also an older-generation, developed prior common rail technology.  It is known for high durability and good resistance to abuse due to substandard fuels and hard working conditions.  All great, but the price was noise, vibrations and short torque curve.The new enviro-friendly diesels are known for overcoming many of those issues (lower noise, not as much vibrations, better power delivery), but the price paid is steep - high maintenance and much reduced durability.  So, if having to choose between noisy durable diesel, or quiet fragile diesel, I choose gasoline engine.I think many Americans confuse marriage of reason between Europeans and diesel with some kind of love without limits.  Europeans opt for diesels mostly because their governments push them to do so by taxes on both vehicles and fuel and because diesels to get better gas mileage.  In the world of fuel priced at $6-8, a lawn mower may be attractive for people mover."
3191,habitat1,"January 11, 2013 1:28PM","Would never switch my 328i for it (or previous WRX/STI, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years.Not sure comparing a 328i to an older A4 1.9 TDI is a fair comparison.  I'm driving a 2013 328ix loaner today with 1,400 miles on the odometer.  Great car, but I have to say that the 335d would be my strong preference for both performance and fuel economy over a 328i.  Had to shut off the engine start stop feature to maintain my sanity in stop and go traffic.  There is no diesel clatter in my friend's 2011 335d and it definitely has more punch when you need to accelerate on the highway.  He gets an honest 40 mpg on highway cruising at 75 mph and 30 mpg overall.  The trip computer on the 328ix loaner shows 23.3 mpg overall; probably heavy city driving.That said, the current 8,400 rpm NA V8 M3 with a 6-speed manual is about as sweet as a 3 series gasoline engine can get.  I'd be the first to admit that if a really sporty, engaging drive is what you want, hard to beat a naturally aspirated high rpm manual transmission car like the M3."

3194,graphicguy,"January 12, 2013 8:55AM","FN....just got home from the CES show in Vegas (~150,000 attendees).  The cabbies are, in my estimation, the best gages for how the Vegas economy is doing.  According to them, Vegas is coming along nicely with the recovery.Anyone who's been there knows the range of vehicles they use as taxis are all over the map.  My limo guy picked me up at the McCairn in a 735i.  Town cars aren't the limo of choice these days, so it seems.Asking one of the Prius taxi drivers if he'd consider a diesel, his answer was swift and emphatic....NO!His reasoning was the hybrids and gasoline cars have the same longevity these days.  Plus, the additional cost of buying diesel fuel offsets any additional MPG.Segueing back to ELLPS, our 335i and S4 both get 20-21 MPG+ in the city, and nearly 30 MPG highway.  These are performance cars capable of 0-60 sub 5 sec times that will cruise all day at 130 MPH + in quiet and comfort.Manufacturers have tried to get diesels to be more appealing in the U.S.  I know a small, but vocal segment like them.  They won't be successful here, however."
3195,habitat1,"January 12, 2013 11:17AM","I think unfortunately your ""dino"" forum name perhaps belies a few dinosaur like biases towards diesels?The difference in price between a 2011 335d and the 2013 328i is a fraction of the difference between a 328i and a old VW 1.9 TDI.  The 2013 328ix I had as a loaner had a sticker price of just under $51,000.As far as ""anybody who enjoyed American-market based ELLPS would never even consider a diesel""?  Are you talking about the 95% of American ELLPS buyers that end up in a slush box automatic with a non-sport suspension?  Or the 5% that really want and buy a sport sedan?  Because if it's the latter, unless you are in a 335is with a real 6-speed manual and sport suspension, you aren't giving up much of anything in the 335d.  Its competitive 0-60, MORE than competitive 30-80, can be equipped with a sport package suspension, etc.  I think I could spec out a 335d that would put it ahead of 90% of the so called American market ELLPS's on the ""S"" front.  And the fact that it would get 30 mpg overall and near 40 mpg on the highway would be a bonus.Fact is, the 3 series has become a little less ""S"" with it's weight gains, size gains, and lower revving turbo engines.  Great cars, no doubt, but the real ""S"" customers are probably heading towards a 135iM on one end, M3 on the other.  So, given that, I see the 335d - and even more so the new breed of M diesels, including the M550d - being extremely competitive with their gas counterparts for the average American buyer.  Especially those that consider themselves ""S"" oriented, but come up with various reasons for not getting a stick.As for more maintenance and reliability, that is the big advantage of diesels.  We have plenty of 300TD's and SDL's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles.  Their counterparts - old 525i's have been recycled into paperweights long ago.I just put a deposit on a 2014 Cayman S last night.  So obviously I'm not in disagreement with the fact that a high revving, naturally aspirated gas engine mated to a real manual transmission is the choice of preference for a sports car.  But that's not what most 3.600+ lb ELLPS buyers are looking for, and I think current and future diesel technology will make more and more sense for the ELLPS application."
3196,dino001,"January 12, 2013 12:06PM","We have plenty of 300TD's and SDL's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles.You missed my point, exactly.  Those 300 TD are old style diesels, true million milers, indestructible machines that would run on vegetable oil.  They were also noisy, slow, awkward.  The new E350 Bluetec is nothing of that.  Yes, it is quiter, fast, nice, but its durability is not million miles, by a long shot.  The old magic of ""running forever"" is gone.  Even commercial vehicle drivers (bus, truck and such) confirm that the new machines are nowhere near in terms of durability in comparison to the old ones."
3197,dino001,"January 12, 2013 4:53PM","Curious which current diesel or turbo diesel car you think is the best?There isn't much to choose from, at the moment.  Traditionally MB and VAG have good diesel motors, I'm sure BMW can hold its own, too.  They're all in different market segments.  Can't say I have any real opinion, what is better.  I was susprised to hear that PSA (Peugeot/Citroen) was considered one of best in its class.  Honda and Subaru have late diesel entries in JDM and Europe, heard good things about those (it would be really interesting to hear how diesel boxer sounds).  All majors (GM, Ford, Toyota, Nissan) have diesels in other markets, but bringing them here is not so simple, due to diferent environmental rules."
3198,sweendogy,"January 12, 2013 5:35PM",I think I would worry about the electronic gremlins in the dash more then the engine with standard maintience.
3199,nyccarguy,"January 12, 2013 7:34PM","I agree with you dino001.  Manufacturers that offer diesels don't work for me.  I'd welcome the extended range & consider the price differential as an engine upgrade.VW offers cheap diesels, but frankly long term durability scares me.BMW's twin turbo Diesel I6 is a gem.  I'm not in the market for a $65K X5d.  Even CPO, they are pricey.  The E90 335d is only offered in RWD.I'm not in the market for a $55K Bluetec E350 or ML 350 either."
3200,m6user,"January 12, 2013 10:21PM","In regards to hybrids, is there a hybrid sold in the US that does not have a CVT?Yes, the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima hybrid models both use the same reg auto transmission as their non-hybrid versions."
3201,dino001,"January 12, 2013 10:27PM",I also believe Honda CRZ can even be had with manual.  But that is so-called soft hybrid.
3202,dino001,"January 13, 2013 11:07AM","I agree there may be a anti-diesel bias in emission regularions here, so it is fair to say there would have been more of them in smaller vehicles, if not for it.  Considering Europe has 50% penetration through heavy regulation, US has nearly zero, also due to bias, 10-20% ""natural"" penetration makes sense to me, if regs were left neutral.  There are legitimate uses for diesel in smaller vehicles, mostly in high mileage highway application, a bit less in city, but still.  Cabs, minivans, some SUVs, especially those used hauling boats, or outdoors/off-road.  Anything that hints severe operaton, heavy duty, long running times. Diesels last longest when kept warm, virtually on at all time, running at constant speeds."
3203,habitat1,"January 13, 2013 6:05PM","Again, just an opinion, but based on some general engineering priciples I use at work in another field (structures).I respect your general comments, but I think you need to take blind opinion-ism and replace it with a little more objective research and analysis.  For example:According to NADA, the retail resale value of a 2008 Mercedes E320 CDI with 75,000 miles is $26,065.  The resale value of the same E350 is $22,925.  The E550, $27,750.  If you increase the mileage to 120,000, the CDI begins to approach the E550 resale and is well ahead of the E350.There is no doubt in my mind, based upon everything from objective resale values, to experience of friends and colleagues, to what I have heard and read from both mechanics and mechanical engineers, that the current Mercedes Bluetec and BMW diesels are MORE durable and less likely to require major repairs than their gasoline counterparts, especially in high mileage use.You are entitled to form your opinions on whatever biases you may have, but I think a bit of actual research may prove them to be incorrect."

They are both priced similarly, but I think the Accord can be had for $1 or $2K less than the TSX. The Accord has much much more power vs the TSX and better fuel economy with the cylinder deactivation on freeway. The Accord ride is refined yet it handles decently. The TSX ride is jittery. The TSX probably does handle better at the limit, but who drives like that anyway? The Accord is a 6 speed auto and TSX is 5 speed auto. The interior of the TSX is maybe a touch nicer, but with the Accord you get a backup camera without having to pay for NAV. With the TSX you have to get the NAV to get the backup camera. After comparing these I don't see any reason to buy the TSX. Am I missing something? I even think the 4 cylinder Accord is a much better value than the TSX."

The new Mazda6 just went on sale a few days ago with the gas engine only.  the diesel is projected to arrive around the Oct-Nov timeframe.  The CX-5 is also planned to get the diesel but it has not been confirmed yet as to timeframe.  They will probably see how the diesel sells in the Mazda6 since the CX-5 is selling like hotcakes with the 2.0 gas engine already.  Now that the new 2014 CX-5 is going to get the 2.5l engine it will probably appeal to an even broader market as the only real complaint anybody had about the current CX-5 was that it neeeded a little more zoom-zoom which the larger engine will provide."

As luck would have it, the loaner I did get is a 2011 E90 335d.  I've never driven a diesel before and I am impressed to say the least.You definitely hear the diesel clatter at idle and at low speeds, but the 335d doesn't stay at low speeds for very long.  Passing power in this car at highway speeds is completely 100% effortless.  The engine is smooth at high speeds and you'd be hard pressed to notice you are driving a diesel on the highway.Now the bad part.  I attribute this to the tires that have almost 39,000 miles on them and are close to shot, the car's 425 lb ft of torque, and the rain slicked roads, but I saw the stability control light flicker a lot more than it does in my car.  I really don't know if I can do without AWD here in Connecticut.The dealer I bought my car from and service it at (not the closest) is about 34 miles away from my house.  On the 98% highway drive, I averaged over 35 mpg doing well over 70 most of the way."

Someone turned the car in before me & the girl at the desk just checks the gas gauge.  I'm sure nobody notices or bothers to tell if there is a problem.I happen to NOTICE EVERYTHING when it comes to cars.  I checked the tires just now (it was dark when I left this AM) & the rears are down to the wear bars.  Fronts still have some life left in them.

The 7 series that we build was priced $83K, that was before the ED price, which was $5K less so $77K would have been the price (special note, for 2013, the M sport package is free on the 740i, BMW will give you credit if you order it.)  Yes, BMW goes give air fare but the restrictions on it aren't to my liking, and you can not upgrade using miles to first class or even Business.Also doesn't matter if you can afford 103K or $77K for a car, saving 5K on the car is a great program."

One could assign a price for it, so a comparison can be made whether it still is a good deal or not, moneywise.  I suspect it's a financial break even plus experience and extra expense for the rest of the trip.I had similar thing on BMW - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ED, there was additional coupon on US delivery, so ED price was not really as attractive, basically about same, maybe $1000 lower than US street (final) price and I still had to buy a ticket.   I also did not get best financing offer, either, as I had to rely on dealer's offer (no bank will give you a loan on car without a title, it is the dealer who needs to vouch for you).  The terms weren't bad, just not ""best"" I refinanced the car right out of the US Customs' gates (at the time I booked 3.8%, refinanced into 2.6% APR).But experience is what counts.  138 mph on the autobahn (could not quite get to the top speed, not enough of runway), Rhein river castles, Aachen and Cologne Cathedrals...

The fact that they increased the eco credit to $4,500 in June, just as my daughter was getting her driving license and we could use another vehicle was good timing all around.

3254,nyccarguy,"December 19, 2012 8:56PM","Ok, so all is well after my 2011 328xi's 1st service.  ECU was re-flashed which got rid of the cold start revving, a loose wire was found to be the trouble of the tail light on the left rear trunk causing the light to flicker, the hinges on the hood were adjusted so it is now aligned properly, & a faulty trunk latch will be replaced in about 3 weeks when the part arrives.  The car was washed & vacuumed (believe me, it needed it).So I've got a few parting comments about the 335d they gave me as a loaner car.Between Monday night and tonight, I put 231 miles on the diesel loaner.  The needle was at the 1/2 mark when I filled up and it said I still had over 300 miles until empty.  I did a little more highway driving than normal because I had to drive my Grandma home after dinner (about 25 miles) and then return the loaner (another 28 miles).I filled up with Diesel that was $4.33 per gallon.  Super at the same station was $4.19 per gallon.  I did see another station that was selling diesel for $4.59 and Super for $4.29.In 231 miles, I averaged 42.3 mph & 32.2 mpg.  I was driving normally and not trying to get good gas mileage, it just happened.I hopped into my 328xi and headed back home.  I backed into the driveway and checked my trip computer.  38.8 mph average speed.  21.5 mpg.Both cars have their positives and negatives.The 335d obviously has a HUGE advantage when it comes to power (425 lb ft of torque - ARGH, ARGH, ARGH) and fuel economy (pretty much 10 mpg better real world).  The passing power this car has is just unreal.  Push down on the throttle and it just goes.  Pulls like a freight train.My 328xi's steering is actually heavier than the RWD 335d.  Handling was hard to judge because I was driving a car with tires that NEEDED to be replaced and it is someone else's $50K + BMW that I didn't want to wrap around a tree or telephone pole.The 425 lb ft of torque, RWD, & balding tires made the car's wet weather traction squirmy.  I even saw the DTC light flicker a few times on dry pavement.My 328xi was noticeably quieter and smoother than the 335d.  The around town diesel clatter didn't bother me, but the car's N52 Inline 6 just sings and loves to rev.The verdict.  The diesel motor is just incredible.  The fuel economy it gives is just an added bonus.  For me to put one in my driveway would most certainly cost me more than the buyout on my 328xi, plus I'd have to invest in a set of dedicated winter wheels & tires, and possibly get a used winter beater (Jeep or Subaru).The other diesel cars on the market either won't match up to the way my 328xi drives (VW Passat, Jetta, Golf TDI are all FWD) or they are A LOT more money (X5s aren't cheap, even used).  It has peaked my interest to give a 4 cyl BMW diesel a chance (X1, X3, 3 series) assuming they are out when my lease is up in September 2014."

As it turned out, he went through two Cadillac Escalades in the 5 1/2 years I had the 911, took massive depreciation hits on both, had POS quality issues with each, and had to actually sue his GM dealer over warrant repairs that were faulty.

I have a thought in the back of my mind that I might buy the lease out on my 2011 328xi.  If I do so, I'd like to be prepared.  So I went & bought some Mobil 1 0W-40, a Mann Filter, & an oil filter wrench.  I looked up how to change the oil on an E90 & found plenty of posts & how to videos.  Then I get ready, drive my car up on to a 2 x 4 so I can get a look see.  And there is a metal plate covering the underside of my engine to get to the oil drain plug.  In order to get to it, I'm going to have to now find a way to raise the car.  Dealers charge a lot of money to repair & maintain European cars.  I really don't know how much less expensive using an independent shop would be.  They still have to pay competent mechanics a good wage, pay over head, plus parts.Regarding Porsches.  My Mom has had her 2011 Cayenne V6 for almost 2 years.  She's racked up over 40K miles already & loves it.  Maintenance costs are through the roof though (they wanted 300+ to rotate the tires & another $300+ for an alignment).  So much so that she has the maintenance done at our local BMW Dealer."

And then just have the parts taken away in boxes!as to service, if I ever do get an older BMW, there is a very highly regarded indy shop about 3 miles from my house.  They are factory trained, very experienced, and supposedly reasonable cost (about what you would pay for any reputable repair shop, and way cheaper than a dealer).they only work on BMW and MB (well, they added Mini now).

In my comparative shopping of a new 2014 Cayman S vs. 2013 BMW M3, it looks like that in addition to a roughly $14k difference in actual purchase price between the two, the 4/50 free maintenance from BMW would cost roughly $3,500 on the Porsche (40k miles is a big one) using the dealer.  If I need new brakes during that time, add another $1,500+ BMW advantage.  So that ""free"" maintenance on an M3 really adds at least $2-3k in favor of BMW to the M3 vs. Cayman S, even assuming I go independent on the Cayman service.As for Infiniti, that was a real joke between a friend of mine here several years ago.  I had a 1995 Maxima, he had a 1996 I30.  Exactly the same car mechanically, other than mine was a manual, his an automatic.  I spent less at the Nissan dealer on service over 8 years and 120k miles than he spent in 7 years and 60k miles.  Take Nissan prices for just about everything, multiply them by 1.5 or 2.0 and call them Infiniti prices.

All wheel/tire work is done by a chain -- when I get a new car I buy a lifetime alignment package that will include free rotations.  Every 5k, the car is aligned, tires rotated.  I usually max out on tread life that way.  I would never consider buying a tire from the dealer either -- there are too many companies who will beat their price all day long.  Ford comes closest to offering reasonable tire prices from their dealers, the rest are 30+% higher, or more.I concur with the ""dumb money"" theories -- dealers will overcharge as much as they can.  Once out of warranty, I go to independents who may specialize in certain types of cars as they are usually ex-dealer folks who go out on their own."

That was the last time we bought a car from that dealership nearly - ahem - 20 years ago.My preference is to cultivate a relationship with my advisor and head tech at the dealership and not have to try a garage after warranty is over and redo the same service at the dealers."

Mine (well equipped) would end up with an MSRP of $70.5k+/-and a final net price of just under $63k.    However, if you take it easy on options, a base M3, plus navigation, heated seats, metallic paint and BMW Apps comes in at an MSRP of $64,945.

But alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, I've just about crossed the Tesla off my list.The problem is that the car is a half-baked attempt at an electric vehicle.  They took a ready-made car, the Lotus Elise (which is a horrendously expensive platform to use) and then added a thousand pounds of weight to it in batteries.The Leaf, on the other hand, is a purpose-built EV and while it needs refinement and work, is actually pretty good for a first serious attempt at a EV by a major auto maker.  Yes, I know other cars existed in the past, but this one you can actually *buy* and not lease, and it's not designed with government regulations and making some lawyers happy.  It's designed to actually be a proper vehicle in the marketplace.They did make the S2000 until 2009, so you might actually get a very lightly used S2000.As for new, the Scion FR-S coupe is actually quite compelling.  It's inexpensive, has a good engine and drivetrain layout, and just begs for a supercharger to be added. (my local dealer had brochures for local TRD suppliers/shops in the showroom and was saying that it would be 6 months, tops, before they were able to do it in-house).Independent shops are reporting yields in the 280-320HP range, which would turn it into a European car crusher, much like the NSX was.Yes, it's not Honda.  But it's not a bad second choice if you need fas, fun, and new. (though I'd still take a S2000 in a heartbeat)"
3330,habitat1,"November 1, 2012 10:03AM","not once in all of the years did I read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the S2000 and NSX togetherBut I did that comparison.  With my own butt in the drivers seat and had my own checkbook out..  1996 NSX 30k miles vs. new 2002 S2000.  They were a hell of a lot closer than you might be fooled into thinking from simply reading Road and Track and not doing the comparison yourself.Both the NSX and S2000 were hand built, side by side at the same Japanese factory.  Both had fit and finish were FAR superior to anything made by Honda or Acura in the US. Both were engineered by the same team of Honda's Formula One racing team engineers.  The NSX produced 90 hp/liter without turbos.  Great for it's time in 1990.  They improved it to 91 hp / liter a little later.  The S2000 produced 120 hp / liter in 2000.  You need a $140k 911 GT3 RS to approach that output today,12 years later.  The BMW M3, 104 hp /liter.  Halfway between the NSX and S2000.The bottom line is that the 1996 NSX I almost bought had a price tag of $85,000 new, $15,000 more than the 1996 911 C2.  But by 2002,  even a new NSX was no where near the same performance league as a Ferrari 360 or (cheaper) 911S.  Yet, at under $35k, for the entire 10 year run of the S2000, nothing within $10-20k of its price could match its engineering, build quality or overall performance.   I'm not saying that the NSX wasn't a very good car during its early years.  But way before the end of its run, it had become a underpowered, overpriced, stale car.  And sold a few dozen the last couple of years before Acura finally and mercifully pulled the plug.  The S2000 never suffered that level of competitive deterioration or indignation.  It came in a winner, went out a winner vis a vis its competition.Some people - perhaps you - don' want to give the S2000 credit because it didn't cost $50k+ or carry the same exclusiveness/prestige.  I look at it differently.  Acura had a marginally competitive car in the $85k price range.  It's biggest advantage when it was introduced was that it didn't break.  Porsche fixed their reliability issues.  Acura sat on its hands relative to keeping the NSX performance competitive.  Honda had a sub $35k car that was the class leader, by a big margin, for a decade straight.  That gets my vote.  You can place yours on the NSX."

In fact, it wasn't until about WWII that it was decided to put things like gas pedals and so on in the configuration that they are now in, or to decide which direction doors would open up.So occasionally you got a real gem in the middle of the crap.  Because people were trying everything and anything to be different and maybe make a breakthrough.Today, cars are all jellybeans and are all designed by people that all went to the same half dozen design schools.  You feel like you had to compromise because every car *is* a compromise by the time it gets through a dozen layers of management and meetings.Your next car should be a classic.

3339,plekto,"November 4, 2012 5:49PM","All engines tend to not do well at 10K+ feet.  Some engines run at excess capacity and can compensate and some cannot.  ie - a GM supercharger simply assumes you have normal density air/runs at full pressure and so it's effect at higher altitude is to essentially offer little if any boost to the engine.  Though it will likely make the engine get enough extra air that it will operate fairly normally.Most turbos work similarly.  The downside of turbos, though, is that most of them are attached to tiny engines that have no torque unless the tubro is engaged, so you have to downshift a gear or two to keep the RMPs up enough to get that boost.   This of course is easier with a manual for either type of design, which is why manual transmissions are usually best for high altitude running as well. (snow as well - you can start a manual in 2nd while most automatics need a special snow mode)."

3343,markcincinnati,"November 5, 2012 11:11AM","I think Infiniti and Acura need to be perceived as ""a"" (if not ""the"") brand to talk about (there are other makes as well that need some help in the promotion dept.)I subscribe to ""too many"" auto magazines (my wife says it's too many): Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and Esquire (?).Month-in, month-out these magazines have stories, ads, ""tests"" & news items about Audi and BMW (to name two.) Now I know other cars buy ad space and are written about, too; but, somehow Audi and BMW always seem to be doing something that gets them written about. It is the combination of ""reminder"" advertising coupled with opinion pieces, features, featurettes and actual tests (and cover stories) including long-term tests and comparisons that keeps Audi and BMW in the mind's eye even if it is not ""officially"" tested in this month's issue.Audi, BMW and others (Porsche comes to mind) are often featured in words and pictures that are ""lifestyle"" pieces, just to make sure you're never more than a page turn away from something that shines a light on the brand.Of course if you are an Audi or BMW owner, you are aware of the corporate sponsored ""for owners only"" magazines: the slick, glossy ""lifestyle"" magazines that often out-do Travel & Liesure, Field & Stream and Architectural Digest, among others, for content and style.  Whenever I get my Audi magazine it never ceases to amaze me the apparent expense Audi must take on to produce such a piece.  Often the articles aren't even about the cars, but about some halo lifestyle.The magazines are meant to let you know that having a BMW or and Audi makes you a member of a very exclusive and desirable club.The Acura magazine is OK, but it still looks like it is a thinly disguised advert for Acura -- I can't remember any such ""corporate organ"" from Infiniti.Yes, the cars should be the stars, but marketing to make you want to be a ""member"" of the [fill-in-th-blank] club or to make you want to remain a member of the club is certainly important, too.I haven't had an Audi for 14 months, yet when I got my latest Audi magazine it was worth looking at and reading from cover-to-cover.  I still felt like a member in good standing when I got it.  The feeling wasn't even close when I got my first Acura magazine (14 months after the purchase of a '12 TL.)My wife got a Bimmer magazine and she, too, took time out to page through the entire thing -- hello Infiniti, is this thing on?We have Audi and BMW shirts, sweaters, wind-breaker, car-key fobs, wrist watches and stick pins collected at the auto maker's boutiques in North America and all over Europe.  I even have ""Audi Experience"" note pads that were a gift from Audi as well as a set of 6 wine glasses with the four interlocking rings etched into them (and a complete set of brass Audi coasters to set the wine glasses on to not stain the coffee tables.) Even American Express' platinum card magazine is something most auto brands should hone in on as examples of keeping the proselytizing on-going.Getting a customer to buy-into the brand (you may call it hype or any thing else that means promotion) is important to keeping them in the fold.  Despite my ""logical"" and ""rational"" reasons for not re-upping for Audi #30 last year, I still feel a kinship to the brand.The auto makers on this list could take a page out of Audi, BMW, Porsche's and (probably) Mercedes play books.That (the above) is ""What Is Going on with Infiniti (?)"".Drive it like you live or drive it like ""they"" make you think you are living.:surprise:"

At NO additional charge.  That includes a free night and dinner at the Marriott, 3 hours of track and off road time with BMW's professional racing/driving instructors, a tour of the 4.5 million s.f. factory and as much time as you want browsing the BMW museum and reminiscing about what you were doing when the pristine 2002 tii on display was their hot little car.  I don't know what this costs BMW to put on - I went through at least $500 in tire rubber and brake pads trying to keep an X5d ahead of some young guy and his wife chasing me in an M3.(2)  Porsche Driving Events:  The BMW sister Porsche dealership, not to be outdone, invited me and my wife to a Sunday driving event 5 weeks ago.  The instructor to student ratio was about 1 to 3 and for a total of 12 of us, they had no fewer than 4 Panameras, 4 Carrera S's and 2 Boxster S's for us to throw around the track.  I KNOW I went through at least $1,000 of rubber at this one.I think Audi does similar events.Frankly, Acura and Infiniti (not to mention Lexus and a few others) probably shouldn't even try to replicate this type of marketing.  You really need the goods to show off, if you do.   Compared to the X5, our MDX would either burn right through the flimsy brakes or flip on its roof on the track, or break in half trying to go through 24"" of water and up and down boulders in the off road course.Whether or not I ever buy another Porsche, I'll be doing some word of mouth marketing on behalf of the company for a few years as a result of that one Sunday morning."

Yet, what we've not discussed is the fact that all of these car companies -- even the ones that are ""related"" (like Audi, Porsche and VW, et al) -- make whatever helps them meet their revenue, volume and profit objectives.  Some time ago, a BMW owner told me, as he looked down on my Audi, that BMW would never produce anything other than RWD cars.I'd say we've pretty much incorporated X-drive across virtually all BMW's -- because they sell and because they make profit.Someone told me that Porsche would never make a CUV (or SUV) and would never create a sedan and that Porsche's were ""only"" about performance -- then the 944 came out.BTW there is a team of lawyers who look out for the use of coke (little c) -- they always want to see it as Coke.  Likewise quattro is well, ""quattro"" not Quatro or Quattro -- the Audi legal team will, no doubt, be sending Edmunds a cease and desist demand if they allow us to post the brand incorrectly.Virtually all I see here in Cincinnati are AWD Porsches -- and I suspect the two Porsche dealers are happy as a clam in its shell to sell as many of them as they can get their hands on.For most mere mortals, living through even our ""moderate"" winters, AWD vehicles are more, dare I say, practical.

I get my ""advisor"" (who is basically a sales person) simply print out a piece of paper with $600 ""worth"" of service they ""recommend"" and casually saying like nothing that's what they're going to do.  It is:- four wheel alignment (well, OK that may be a legitimate item for those concerned, but why isn't that covered than if all is supposed to so free, free, free):  $200.   WHAT???!!!!  :mad:  Market rate is between $50 (with coupon) and $80, I understand that's a premium place, but not at a tripple rate.- engine induction system cleaning.   Yeah, right at 15K miles it's soooo dirty, especially when using a brand premium gas.  I have never done one and I owned some perfomance cars, like STI.  No thanks.  BTW, price is also $200, a little over double of market.-  power steering fluid flush.  Really?? At 15K??? Are your serious???  Oh, also $200.Wow.  So this is how ""free, free, super free"" service looks like - nice isn't it? Absolutely ridiculous, both in terms of ""recommendations"" and prices.

But when you count all those ""recommended"" services at those highly inflated prices, it's like paying for that good will, just up front.  I'll do when it comes, got enough money for that.

The car stays overnight at the shop, as they have to paint the new piece in my color.They also agreed to replace a torn door sill - it was me, hitting it hard every time I got out of the car, the sill split it two at point of those impacts, about 3 inch long split.  I must admit, it was because the way I like to sit (lowest possible, as far as possible), combined with my weight and general clumsiness when getting out.

So I'm thankful for that - not expecing to get such consideration if keep banging this sill on next service, so I'll try to excercise more caution when getting out of the car.I also lost an undercarriage bumper for the lifts (it was discovered in a tire shop some time ago) - $69 to put it back.

I'm also cognizant that my car is one of cheapest they have out there, so the perspective is different - somebody with $100K 7-series may not care if alignment is $100 or $200, but they may care more about ""concierge"" type of service that you get in such a place.  Those ""free"" perks can be quite costly.  I don't need them, I'd rather keep my money, but again - they cater to people who do care and such a treatment costs money.

This was planned maintenance visit used as an opportunity for an upsell, because they think that whatever BMW pays them is not enough.  They invented a bogus need for some preventative stuff that don't really need, but nobody can disprove such need.  I'm already used to that - every time you have an AC service as maintenance, the guy without a fault will ""recommend"" duct cleaning, coil cleaning and other equally ""preventative"" stuff, not to mention a UV lamp to kill bacteria with a bargain price of over two grand, or electrostatic filter for another two.All I need is to say no and they go away."

I don't want my first impression to be too harsh, and intend to go back with my wife when she can do a test drive in the next week or two.  But I think Tesla might have more of a packaging problem with the interior than their sexy photographs and YouTube videos suggest.  The seats were Toyota Camry quality and the empty area below the dash and between the driver and passenger seat (where the gear shift and center console would normally be) looked awful and detracted from the sense that you were sitting in a high tech, high quality cockpit.   Neither the car I test drove nor the other one in the showroom had the panorama sunroof.  Too bad, because the headliner looked like it was poorly fitted and finished.  Which was also the case with the leather on the showroom model's seats.  Overall, other than the 17"" screen and dash, I was  underwhelmed by the interior design, fit and finish.The test drive itself was much better.  Car has good acceleration from a standstill, even the ""base"" model I drove.  It was even more impressive going from 40 to 70 on the highway.  I am sure the performance model is a hoot to drive.

I don't think they are trying to compete with BMW and Audi for the serious driving enthusiast in these segments, as evidenced by no manual transmissions, a chassis emphasis on comfort rather than handling and slush box automatics vs. DSG's.

To be fair, I think it was ""sports"" C300 and non-sport package 328, so a bit unfair to the bimmer.  But my though was Benz had nothing to be ashamed of - at all.

3370,markcincinnati,"October 31, 2012 11:34AM","Beginning on page 62 of the Dec '12 issue of ROAD & TRACK and continuing through page 65, Honda has spent however much it takes to buy a 4-page, full color advertising spread dedicated to the ""theme"" and title ""The Name of The Game."" There is a boat load of text describing in the best copy writing money can buy, probably, the technologically advanced 2013 Honda Accord. From LED headlights to a feature-laden interior to the description of how the '13 Accord is both smaller on the outside and bigger on the inside.Of course the patient reader is told about the achievement of the ""neat trick"" of being more maneuverable, more powerful and more economical. The damn thing is safer, too -- it says so right in the ad copy.The car is full of such amenities as Pandora radio, Bluetooth this and that, a rearview AND sideview cameras , sat-nav, a voice activated bidet, collision warning, lane departure warning, LaneWatch, a George Foreman fryer with GreaseBlock technology, and even an available 6-speed MANUAL shifter, and to motivate the thing, you can get a 278 horsepower V6 that actually reverses the greenhouse effect of SMOG (on a planetary basis) and (apparently) push-button start and hands-free ingress if you are so inclined.Don't forget adaptive cruise control -- Honda didn't overlook this tech either.I'm sure I've missed stuff, I mean, c'mon the ad is four pages in length and mostly uses a small font as if this is an article about the thing, not an ad.OK, so I read this and I see the picture of the interior which approaches handsome, not Audi handsome but a far cry from any Honda I've ever been turned-off by (including my '12 Acura TL, which, while quite functional is hardly grin inducing when you get behind the wheel.)Now, then, as to the title of my post -- I'm used to the Audi A8 getting the bells and whistles long before the A4 and usually before the A6 and way way way before Audi's ""cousins"" the VW clan. I'm at least aware that Cadillacs [used to] get features, functions and other high-end content (aka, ""stuff you'd like to have in your Chevy or Pontiac or Buick, even) before the lesser aspirational models. I assume that the new ATS, CTS and XTS all have content that is, for the time being, exclusive to Caddy's -- wouldn't want a lowly Buick LaCrosse to have blind spot monitoring or adaptive cruise control or whatever gimcrack or gewgaw du jour marks a Premium Car's territory (these days).The top o' the line from any car maker or ""family"" of cars usually gets the new tech, new toys, new safety kit or partridge in a pear tree BEFORE those poor cousins downstream, er, down-market.So, this 2013 Accord gets content, tech, etc, etc, that certainly seems like prime beef from as recent as 2011 in many of the world's high buck, high zoot, high prestige makes. Hell, this Accord seems awfully close to being premium-car state-of-the-art insofar as content and even safety engineering (high strength steel, and ""ACE II"" a body structure engineered to evenly distribute full-frontal crash energy [or nudity] more effectively for instance).  Now the engine choices are hardly revolutionary, but they do (claim) to now include direct injection powerplants, CVT transmissions with paddle-shifters (yawn) and ""double-downshifting"" conventional 6-speed autos with rev-matching.My point is, shouldn't all this content, kit, performance and safety rigging be introduced FIRST in the Acura line?  Then after two-years, one at-least, and only then be trickled DOWN to the Honda's?What a world, what a world --The Wicked Witch from the Wizard of OZ.Drive it like you live.DOH!Homer."

I got a fun to drive ""sporty"" (vs. sport) sedan that had more room for the family, good ergonomics and technology, and excellent reliability.But....I would still contend that part of infiniti's problem is self inflicted.  They themselves tried to compare the g35 to the 3 series in marketing materials.  And by producing a coupe version that is essentially a refined 370z with a back seat, they were clearly hoping to win the comparison on performance and driving dynamics.You can keep contending that they are a viable alternative for other reasons and attributes.  I agree.  But flight can also contend that, unlike the TL or Lexus ES, the G set itself up for and encouraged a more direct comparison to the 3 series on those attributes that fell short.The G is what it is and people can and do buy it based ( hopefully) upon the actual attributes."

Nothing wrong with that.  Ask any small business person how that works out.  You must have very large quantity of scale to compete on price.

I won't repeat for the nth time some of the attributes of the G that can compete with the BMW besides just price but suffice to say that it has things that people look for in a ELLPS besides just price.  I do agree that there is nothing wrong with being second best at a lesser price if you have a business model that makes a profit by doing it.   Agreed that if ALL you are going to sell on is price than huge scale is necessary but as I've already said, I don't believe that is the case with Infiniti.  Street prices for the G are much less than the 3 but so are just about every other comparable car out there.  When you have the cache you can price high.  That's capitalism."

IMO the G and 328 are the respective ELLPS models and at about the same entry MSRP.  A 335 with leather, etc is about $10k more.  I use leather at it's standard in the Infiniti.   The base TL and the sh-awd TL is a similar situation but the price difference isn't as substantial.  Same with the A4 vs. S4.  The 328, TL, G, A4 all are about the same starting MSRP I believe."

A poor name in one - at the time small market - doesn't mean a company is destined for the scrap heap, as evidenced by their continued success worldwide.Here in Europe I believe the 5000 was badged as a 200 and was highly regarded, i.e. the 100's big brother. I don't recall any similar incidents over here, at the time or since, with Audi cars.  I don't drive an Audi; never owned one as I believe they are over-priced VWs in pretty dresses. I much prefer my VWs dressed as Skodas for many reasons, not just price but also better build quality and dealerships. However, Audi have been building fine cars for a long time and, if you must have the badge and are prepared to part with the money, then why not ?Interesting that Audi are a relative newcomer to the high-end market, (or any market), unlike Skoda who have been around for considerably longer and even survived the disaster that was East European Communism.  The original Skoda Superb was a competitor for Rolls Royce et al in it's day.  Try the Googly thing to see about it.

Quatro: 3,616 lbs.Wheels and tires have gone from 15"" 215 series on Maxima to 17"" 225-245 series on Audi/BMW.  In fairness, the Maxima has gone up to 3,551 lbs, and is now 190.6 inches long and 73.2 inches wide.  That's A6/535i size, both of which are pushing 4,000 lbs.  Also, in spite of the greater exterior width of the A4 and 328 compared to the older Maxima, the interior width (shoulder/hip) is almost identical.  Much of the exterior width difference is in flared fenders and design elements.I don't think we should go backwards in structural rigidity and crash worthiness.  But I have to question how much that accounts for the significant weight increases since the mid 1990's.  You can have very light safety cages that can withstand tremendous stresses, as Formula One proves.Oh well, I'm up about 10% in body weight since buying my 1995 Maxima.

I have no real proof (other than what I read in Car & Driver, et al) of my observation that Audi has built its reputation on AWD (at least in the US, if not elsewhere) and it has, of course, marketed itself, trademarked, copyrighted, and probably patented its ""image"" (if possible) on quattro and ""The Four Intersecting Rings.""Audi has labored and fought hard to be equated with ""quattro"" just as a famous cola manufacturer has fought hard to be called Coke; or as hard as a tissue manufacturer has fought to be called Kleenex.If Audi reverted to FWD instead of AWD several things would happen and not many of them would be good (at least from both marketing and performance perspectives).  And there is no way I [at least] could ever imagine Audi marketing RWD cars -- any more than Coke wants any cola product to be called coke (with a little ""c"").Audi would also probably point to near premium, premium, and super premium (and exotics, too) cars that are all-wheels-driven vehicles.Several of the world's greatest automakers save AWD for their highest performing models. Perhaps AWD is in Porsche's blood what with Audi, VW and Porsche all being related.  Perhaps Lamborghini too has AWD in its blood due to Lamborghini's relationship with Audi. The same for Bentley.Audi would probably argue that AWD is their performance vehicles' ""secret"" [not really secret, of course] weapon or sauce as the analogy might go.I love the use of the phrase ""pig-headish"" -- and assume it was meant to be ironic or at least be a double entendre since Audis are ""front end"" (or head end, as opposed to butt end) heavy.I just don't see Audi doing anything else than continuing to embrace AWD -- especially for its highest performing cars.   :shades:"

I've been casually shopping for a replacement for my 911 C2S that I sold 18 months ago.  In the process, I've attended a Porsche track event and test driven several cars, new and used.  The conversations I've had with Porsche employees, enthusiasts, and professional drivers has been pretty educational.Bottom line, very few serious Porsche enthusiasts consider the 911 Turbo (AWD) to be the pinnacle of the 911 line.  They put the GT3 RS4.0 on top, GT3 next followed by GT2.  Some would put the new 991 C2S ahead of the 997 Turbo.  They like naturally aspirated engines and RWD.  The GT2 is the RWD answer to the Turbo S, and is fast as hell, but not preferred by them over the GT3.The AWD 911 Turbo and various ""4"" cars were, as explained to me, partly based off the fact that the 911 RWD has a front/rear weight balance of roughly 37/63 and some buyers liked having another 150+/- lbs over the front wheels and some extra grip.  That was usually followed by a thinly veiled ""amateur"" adjective to further describe that type of buyer.   But not the preference of the serious enthusiasts, it seems.  As a matter of fact, I have heard from several that they have acquired 993 Turbos (last of the air cooled engines) and actually disconnected the front drive train to make them RWD.The Cayman and Boxster will never be AWD.  They are already perfectly balanced and light.My pig headed comment was probably unfair.  Audi has built quite a reputation on Quatro.  But remember, they started out as FWD, which is the worst of all worlds, so AWD was really a necessity if they didn't want to fire all of their engineers and start over.  A RWD TT RS is probably not in the works, and the fact that the heavier AWD TT RS has none of the feel and sharpness of a Cayman S or R is probably not important to the typical Audi customer.

But looking back, I definitely think Infiniti had been marketing the G35 much more as a ""BMW beater"" than Acura ever did with the TL.The problem isn't necessarily that Infiniti doesn't quite have BMW beat in performance and driving dynamics.  They are still WAY ahead of Lexus in that department.  The problem becomes when their marketing department tries to sell attributes that their engineers don't deliver on.  You don't hear a Lexus dealer claiming that an ES is a BMW 335i beater.

Given a choice of a 6, 7, 8 or more speed clutchless auto, CVT auto or regular auto, most folks -- by far -- seek to go clutchless.I say we all better get over it and realize that stick shifts make for good TV commercials and perhaps make for good reading about -- for those of us with too many car magazine subscriptions, but overwhelmingly at least 97.5% of ""us"" (even those who have NO problem driving a stick) wouldn't even consider a stick and certainly wouldn't consider ordering one and waiting 12 weeks for it to arrive.A contemporary 8-speed ""slush"" is so much better than the 4,5 and even some 6 speed autos of the not-too-distant past most folks probably say ""why bother"" (with a stick shift)? The 7-speed DSG's are also wonderful and in most cases (if you believe the test reports) are able to equal and often better 6-speed manuals.Stick shifts make for good ad copy and for the 2.5% of us who might actually buy one, it is nice to know sticks aren't dead (yet).  The truth of the matter -- for me -- is that I would rather spend time and treasure on a sport suspension package, sport seats, wheels and super sticky tires (even the Max Performance tires, tho, are rapidly becoming an endangered species here in the US where most folks don't swap wheels and tires for summer and winter duty.)The 10th largest BMW dealership (according to them, at least) is here in Cincinnati -- they have no manual transmission new cars on the lot.  If you ask them, they say there is little use in floor planning them since they sit forever, until they are discounted so heavily that folks are willing to ""settle"" for a stipped-down base Bimmer.If you want to blame something for the stick's demise (besides ignorance and apathy -- and indifference), blame mobile smart-phones.  You can't possibly drive a stick shift when you have both hands on the phone texting your little heart out, all the  while steering with your knees.Hell, I'll go so far as to suggest that the self-driving car can't come soon enough for most folks.:surprise:"
3405,m6user,"October 9, 2012 9:22AM","It's been several years since I've been in an Infiniti dealershipWow, there's some real credibility speaking here.  Yes, I'm sure that I don't think Infiniti is trying to clone a 3.  Can't prove it that why I said ""I think"".  I believe you may have marketing confused with reality.  Everybody markets their cars to be this or that.  Even, BMW with their crappy stop/start system and steering that is getting to be more vanilla every year.  The BMW 328 is slow in straightline compared to a G but every BMW fanboy comes back and says ""oh, but straightline speed means nothing...it's the driving dynamics of the BMW that are so good"".  Ok, if one cares so much more about driving dynamics that speed than get a BMW.  If one wants OK dynamics but also some great power get a G among other things considered.  The standard TL is like a boat compared to the standard G.  Now the sh-awd TL is great but is still huge compared to the G or the BMW 3.  It's the size of the current 5 series.BTW, I would match Infiniti's reliability and maintenence costs  against Acura anyday.  I presently own an Acura and owned an Infiniti for 10 years until two weeks ago."
3406,markcincinnati,"October 9, 2012 10:10AM","My wife and I have had so many German cars, I do feel I can offer up a data point or two, rather than ""just"" an anecdote.Audis and BMW's (through 2009, at least) are breathtakingly expensive to have beyond their factory warranties. I say this even though I now would ""risk"" keeping one of these Germans beyond 50,000 miles.I would, however, start to get downright nervous (and twitchy) once my German car got beyond 60,000 or perhaps 65,000 miles.Not so with Acura's and Infiniti's.I must inject here that we have had 29 Audis, 3 BMW's and 3 VW's since the late 1970's and only two ""Japanese"" representatives -- a 2012 Acura TL Advance SH-AWD and a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD.Here is why I qualified my observations regarding the Acura and Infiniti:  we've only had 2 of them and we have had both of them less than 2 years (each).  For all I know, the Acura and Infiniti will blow up (expense wise) just like the Germans, post-50,000 miles.  I doubt it and here's why.Every German car we've had is, ""at birth,"" the best driving auto ever -- and then at 5,000, 10,000 and sometimes even 15,000 miles they get even better (the engine finally reaches its maximum efficiency apparently.) Yet, somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 miles, the German car really needs a ""tune up"" just to keep its (or my) spirits lifted.  What I mean by this is that the German cars, thus far in my experience, have been the best driving and performing cars ever, time after time.  Yet, these high-strung darling's age so quickly, so noticably and they just ""loose that lovin' feelin'"" unless they are maintained by sacrificing so very much coin of the realm. In the case of the Audis and BMW's -- thankfully -- bumper to bumper maintenance for 50,000 miles masked what that man behind the curtain was doing to keep pumping up the Audi and/or BMW to approximately full strength.Put simply, the Germans show their age unless given lots of TLC ($).Conversely, my wife's FX with about 35,000 miles on it is showing virtually no visual wear and is also ""feeling new"" -- there was no need for a mini overhaul post 25,000 miles as was required on every German car we've ever had (to maintain that new car feeling.)  My Acura, too, at 25,000 miles seems to deny any perceptable effects of the miles on it.   Only the front rotors on the Acura (which felt way warped at 8,000 miles) give anything about its age away -- and the rotors, after three turnings are eligible to be replaced under warranty (I've had them turned twice, to no avail.)So, from my perch, looking down on the dozens of cars the missus and I have had since the '70's, I would say if you want great driving cars (temporarily great, that is) go German, and just realize they are the equivalent of being married to a super model -- they're high maintenance to keep up appearances.The Japanese cars aren't quite the ""lookers"" that the Germans are, but they are reliable and durable in ways, thus far, that seems to have eluded Germany's finest.Now, one final comment -- I would not hesitate to get another Audi.  I do believe they are virtually if not literally as reliable as any of the competition.  I also believe they are not even close to being as durable as these Premium Japanese cars are -- the Germans age so quickly and are oh so very expensive to ""keep young.""  I don't know what secret sauce seems to prevent the Japanese cars from aging -- apparently, at least.  Yet, it just seems like the old adage, you may have superior performance with high overall maintenance costs or reliability and durability with low overall maintenance costs, but not both.Here's the thing -- all of these cars (ELLPS) are far more capable performers than most of us are driviers; and, all of these cars (ELLPS) are reliable at least to 50,000 miles.  What we seem to be facing -- today, at least -- a choice of driving a great car that dies young or driving a very good car that outlasts your affection for it.Maybe good really is the enemy of great.""Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops.""- Thomas J. Watson of IBMMy TL is a good car, no matter what you say!  :P"

Now, I did say, that C/D stated that the BMW was the overall winner, in fact, that is why C/D has always picked the 3 series as the winner, because of the over all feel, way it drives. I think you need to re-watch the last part of the video to hear what they say.Don't know what you mean by ""on paper the G should be better"".If you read a posting I posted you would have gotten this. The G's chassis is what Nissan call's the FM platform, where the engine sits behind the front wheels, this like the RX-8 makes for a better handling car, chassis is plenty stiff, RWD, weight in line, manual trans, hefty V6, however, Nissan for what every reason missed the mark on some points. Hopefully the next generation G all the short coming of the current G will be worked out."
3408,plekto,"October 9, 2012 11:54AM","Don't forget, though, that this also is a huge plus for Cadillac.  Repairs are inexpensive (parts are actually less now than Toyota or Honda!) and they happen fairly infrequently compared to the European makes.  Add in pretty decent incentives (incentives from Acura or Lexus??), and it's compelling.$32K for a CTS (actual price via Truecar on a 2012, which isn't as low as you can negotiate yourself, even) versus $40-45K or more for a 3 series (335i)...  It certainly makes you wonder.  The smart money is on the CTS and to simply ignore the ATS until you can get one next fall in the 27-28K range after incentives.As for my father's CTS, in two years it's had zero warranty repairs or issues with it.  Nothing squeeks, rattles, or feels any different than the day he bought it.  Quite a departure from his previous GM vehicles.  You'd swear it was made by Totoya.  But the engine is without a doubt made in Germany.  It's exactly like having a BMW or Mercedes engine and a body that is made by Totoya - just without their appalling lack of styling."

As far as loyality goes, I would love to have another Infiniti but they just don't make the type and size of vehicle that I now want(not talking about a G here).  It has nothing to do with with liking the brand.  If they made a vehicle that was very similar to the Acura I just bought then I would have bought it in a heartbeat. Besides I also like to sample different brands from time to time.  Never know what you're missing until you try it, right?   Are you saying that I should be loyal to brand without fail?  That would be pretty stupid IMO.  No brands are that good or perfect by any means.People seem to take marketing and advertising too literally.  It's just hype.  The only customers who believe the hype and are dissappointed are the naive ones that believe all that crap in the first place.  When a company says it is targeting something they are using it as benchmark.  They are actually complimenting the known quantity by saying they are trying to be like it in many ways, not a carbon copy.  In some ways they succeed and some they don't.  BMW is not perfect either and especially is not the right car for many people.  I pay cash and keep vehicles for at least 6-10 years.  I shy away from cars that need a lot of expensive repairs and maint after the warranty is over because I just don't need the hassle long term.  I can afford the repairs but I just don't want to deal with them.   If I leased or traded every 3-4 years it would possibly be different.Congrats on being able to play baseball at your age whatever it is.  Didn't quite get the connection to the discussion though unless you're constantly marketing yourself as a great baseball player.  Has Infiniti been marketing itself as better than BMW?  I don't believe so.  They may market the G as an alternative to the BMW and that it is, an alternative....not a copy."

3414,plekto,"October 9, 2012 9:37PM","I've owned Mercedes, Toyotas, Volvos (before Ford ruined them), and quite a few other cars.  And the CTS is really bolted together and built like the best cars you can get from Japan.GM basically stole engineers from BMW and Mercedes, so when the engine is built in Germany, well, it really IS built by the best engineers.  It's fantastic.  And BMWs are also fantastic when it comes to the engines and drive-trains.BUT... the rest of the car is... problematic.  I can drive a 2 year old BMW and the interior is already suffering and the fiddly bits and switches and so on are showing their age rather rapidly.    BMW apparently spends everything on how it drives and the rest of it is simply put together like a Kia.  GM actually has at least this part down-pat.  Their interiors are excellent and in fact, often out-last Toyota and Honda.  The rest of their cars in the past was crap, but the interiors were great.Now, they have a good platform and a good interior.  And it won't start crumbling on you at 50 or 80k.  You can just look at the first generation CTS for examples of this.  And they aren't as well built as the 2nd generation.You can laugh.  All the way to the poor house as you're either leasing forever or paying outrageous repair bills for the most silly things.The ATS?  It really needs a little more time to decide if it's a great car or not.  But so far, for a first year model, that it got that close to a 3 series, AND it's not going to suffer from BMW-itis as it ages...  BMW's days are numbered at this rate if GM of all companies can make them sweat."
3415,buya,"October 10, 2012 12:04AM","To me, it's not an addiction. Those cars are better in comprehensive view. I drive and own German built cars only, and I thought it would be snobbish to rule out other cars. It's not. It's preference, just like some people like to hear the revving and roaring of their cars, and some prefer the quietness in their sports cars. I'm not particularly fond of MB, and I swore not to consider buying another MB when I sold my last one. It's been over a decade. I'm still driving a MB and admiring the engineering and handling, but I'm not serious about buying MB. My BMW was a reliable car but the style looked old quickly. I haven't bought a BMW for decades. I moved on to other European cars since MB for their curves. I've to say my cars are all very reliable and I adored them all. What's wrong with MB is that they went cheap on material! I haven't seen anything chipped in any other old or older cars except in the 8 years old SL500. Unforgivable!! These cars are all 1-owner well maintained cars, so it's not maintenance issue. It's MB quality control. I had driven a Camry V4 as a loaner from a non-MB dealer when my car was way out of warranty, and I thought that Camry was very nice. It would be for city driving, but don't take it out of town. Toyota cars have issues like other brands, but the repair costs of a Toyota car is not as high as most German cars. A visit to a European dealership for repair or whatnot can easily set you back $2K + change and that could happen a number of times in a month for the same problem. But it's not the same to the dealers of course.With German cars, durability is not an issue, however, if you can't stand the little annoyances of electronic problems, then you may find reliability to be. Since I'm looking for a sensible car and trying very hard to exclude German cars and other European cars, except VW, Volvo, etc., I test drove a lot of cars that I thought was worthy. Infiniti is cool. Acura SH-AWD are cool. Subaru Flat 4 needs a booster, base Accord 2013 vibrates uncomfortably on city streets, xB is nice, ... So, what's the bottom line? If you're looking for performance of certain type and are used to driving high-end European cars, the best is to stay with the cars you know."

3417,graphicguy,"October 10, 2012 5:06AM","Mark....good summation.  I loved reading Bob Lutz's book about his days with GM.   It was quote eye opening and gave a very clear view why GM had the poor reputation that they've endured over the last few decades (can't believe I just said decades, but there it is).They never really set out to build better cars.  They set out to just build ones that they coule drive out cost...in engineering, materials, build, etc.  The result is what we see today.  They keep claiming they're getting better.  But, it's hard to see where that is the case. And, it won't be until they change their culture.Since the ATS was brought up here, look at what the trade rags say about Cadillac's ""CUE"" system.  Yes....Cadillac can say they have ""tech"" like the other manufacturers.  But, it's so poorly implemented that it's rendered practically unusable.This attitude vs the Japanese or German manufacturers is what denigrates U.S. car companies the most (although, most Ford vehicles I've been in for rentals seem quite competitive).GM can't hit the BMW or Audi in handling without making the ride harsh.  Same can be said for Infiniti.  Acura seems to do a decent job, once you understand you're going to suffer some torque steer with FWD bias.Audi and BMW spend money to use better materials for their suspensions.  It shows when you drive one.  Even the Cadillac CTS I drove (again as a rental), as good is it purported to be, couldn't match the solidity of my BMW's doors when they shut.  And, this was a Cadillac with less than 3K miles on it.Hell......BMW actually has a dept that studies and chooses the most pleasant bells/buzzes to use when a door is ajar.  Think GM would spend money for that?I haven't driven a Lincoln in a long time, so I don't know how they compare.  The last Chrysler 300 I drove (previous gen) wasn't all that impressive...especially from a build and material quality perspective.How long with my BMW last?  Or, my GF's S4?  I really don't know.  The BMW is only coming up on its 2 year birthday.  It's as solid now, and probably performs better than the day it came off the dealer's lot.  The S4 seems to be in the same category.Only time will tell.As Mark says, as good as the TL SH AWD is, she wasn't the marrying type."
3418,graphicguy,"October 10, 2012 7:54AM","habitat....for a couple of years, when I first graduated college, I worked for GM (Fisher Body Plant outside of Cincinnati).  I was doing coding for some very rudimentary robotics machines.  I was salary.  But, some of the same people I went to college with, left their ""degreed jobs"" to work for GM as an hourly employee at this same plant because they out earned me by as much as 40% (overtime).Because of wildcat strikes, work slowdowns, unreliability of those rudimentary ""robots"" I was coding for, I made the leap to hourly work, too.You're dead on in describing the ever present friction between the UAW and Management.  I saw it from both sides, since I had worked both sides of that aisle.  I saw foreman verbally abuse hourly workers (to the point of being as abusive as I've seen two humans could possibly be).  In turn, I saw hourly workers sabotage machinery and ruin body parts (which were eventually shipped to an assembly plant) to retaliate.This was in the '80s.  And, that plant eventually closed down.  I know there was a lot of bitterness at that particular plant.  Don't know if that exists today, or not.  It certainly wasn't conducive to quality car building.  And, GM wasn't all that concerned about quality.  They were quite focused on quantity, though.  Again, something that shows in their products.By contrast, I have toured Honda's plant in Marysville, OH, and the Subaru plant in IN.  As you describe Spartanburg, these plants were clearly as clean as a pin.  And, there is a spirit of cooperation, not distrust, disinterest, and uncooperativeness.I firmly believe that's why Toyota's, Hondas, Audis and as you point out, BMW enjoys the reputation for engineering superiority, build and material quality they do.  They design better products, they make better products, because they plan to.  And they make certain anyone who works for/with them do, too.I heard someone make apoint on one of the radio auto shows a while back that the reason German cars are expensive to keep is because there aren't enough mechanics around who are willing enough to understand how the cars are built and engineered.  So, the dealerships get to charge whatever they want."

I already mentioned that Infiniti was benchmarking the 3 and that it was a compliment to BMW.  Benchmarking is not necessarily an attempt to copy but to strive for similar(not exactly the same) results.  Nobody is saying any car is overall better than the 3 in this segment.  Just saying there are viable competitors that may be better for some people that don't need the epitome of driving dynamics and care more about other things.   If Infiniti was trying to clone a 328 which is what it was price competitive with they could have given it 240hp instead of 325hp and called it a day.  They chose a different route.  Does a car have to be a clone of something else to compete in this category.  Not everyone wants a BMW...plain and simple.   I just wrote a check for 40k for a new Acura.  I could just have well written one for a BMW or even more.  But I really don't want one.  I have nothing against BMW....it's the owners that are obnoxious sometimes.I do not remember reading that Infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series.Kind of hard to prove a negative now isn't it?

The sunroof track cracked and was replaced under warranty. The worst problem was the cooling problem where the temp would start moving way up while climbing hills on a hot day. Many visits to the dealer on my dime while they tried the fan clutch, the thermostat, the radiator, etc. Over $1K on repairs and still not really fixed.Yet I LOVED that car for its interior and its driving. I now own an '05 TL and yet I still miss the Audi. But let me tell you that at 128K on the TL, my only repairs were a OAT temp sensor recall and replacing a couple of door handle trims that fell off. Oh, and the right window regulator sometimes sticks. That's it.

It's kind of funny, because I always thought BMW are hard to beat on the road, but their interiors are designed in 5 minutes that are left after suspension and engine testing and the production deadline.  Dashboards look the same as they did 25 years ago, the aesthetics are quite austere.  Seems to me ATS has a few corrections, but the ones that are easy to make (better touchscreen experience and more cohesive design).So, if anything, C&D piece seems like this:  BMW, we give you first place, but if you keep going this road (of bigger, softer), this may be your last time.  This looks like lifetime achievement award and yellow flag, confirming all those complaints of long-time BMW fans, who simply don't care for the F30, even if it sells well.BTW, this is painful to me to write, but gives me a little satisfaction of validation of my jumping to E91 when it was still available."
3432,plekto,"October 7, 2012 9:39AM","Yeah, I read it the same way.They pulled a Consumer Reports and gave the BMW the win based upon soft and fuzzy nonsense like the seats, and so on.  Basically they looked damn hard for any reason whatsoever that they could to make their favorite car not lose the contest.  Which is to be expected, really, considering that BMW kind of has been the benchmark for the segment since Volvo stopped making sports sedans in the 90s.  They didn't want BMW to lose and any areas which were slight problems were probably given a pass versus them being super critical on the Cadillac.  As is human nature when you're dealing with favorites vs a newcomer.But just like how Mercedes was the luxury car of choice for several decades (say, 1960-1990), BMW is now facing the same sort of problems Mercedes faced when the Japanese got into the fray.  Except this time, it's GM coming for them.  Nobody expected it and it has to be causing a lot of ulcers for BMW and Mercedes.That said, nobody is going to buy the ATS with the puny turbo engine.  Everyone who has the money will buy the 3.6."

3434,dino001,"October 7, 2012 10:44AM","This is a legitimate approach, to go with something you know rather than pick up the newbie, if all things including price are at par.My take on the whole piece it is now up to GM what they do with ATS.  If they see it as a good (great maybe) start and go on relentless self-improvement path, this could be start of something great.  However, GM DOES NOT have best track record of self-improvement.  If they declare a victory and then expect to sell this product unchanged for next 20 years (excaggerating, of course), this will not matter at all and BMW is safe, even if on their own merrit they depart from their core values."
3435,flightnurse,"October 7, 2012 10:50AM","Dino I agree, however, GM has spent a lot of money on the car and have taken a completely different approach on this car as well as the XTS. I'm hoping that GM does continue to improve the car, this is where I think Infiniti lost it. Infiniti is happy to be where they are, I do not see GM being that way. As I stated before, this is great for us, I'm sure BMW will look at the ATS and say, HEY, we need to get serious about this again and make a mid-cycle change to the F30 that will pull it away from the pack... The ATS has more power then the BMW, however the engine in the BMW appears to make the power easier then the ATS..."

This car drives better, with fewer rattles, than any 2 year old Caddy sitting on your local dealer lot.

But, I think it stems from the fact that both Infiniti and Acura were, at least at their inception, marketed as BMW/Mercedes/Audi competitors.  Whether it was ever true, I really don't know.  I know the Legend was, at one time, King of the sport/lux hill.  Lexus always chose the roll of a ""better"" Buick/Cadillac.  The Infiniti M has tried, mostly in vain, to compete with the E Series, 5 series, A6.  It never really crossed that barrier.  The G got close to the BMW3, but never quite got there.  Now, Infiniti seems to have fallen even farther behind.But, I can't tell if this is a temporary thing for Infiniti (or for Acura, for that matter).  We'll see.

3456,habitat1,"September 21, 2012 5:04AM","I don't think anybody knowingly buys a car that is in ""second place"" for what their priorities are.I would agree that if you compare certain driving dynamics of the G37 vs. the 335i you will conclude that BMW has the edge.  But do the same thing for a FWD or even AWD automatic TL, and you come to the same conclusion just as quickly.  Price point, features, maintenance costs, etc. all come into play and - hopefully - one has the good sense to buy what they believe is the right combination for them.The problem would be if Infiniti priced the G37 exactly the same as a 335i, offered exactly the same features and options, marketed the car as a direct competitor to the 335i, but fell short on driving dynamics.  I don't think that's the case here.Personally, I think the 335i would fall into second place if I was buying a sedan today.  At a price that is at or above $55k for a well optioned, performance model, it is way too close to the $65k+/- that I could buy an naturally aspirated 8,400 rpm M3 at.

But, obviously, a lot of people buy Mercedes and Audi based upon other preferences and priorities.Even when I bought my 2004 TL 6-speed, I was willing to compromise on driving dynamics to save $10k, get more space, a little better foul weather traction, and the Acura reliability/lower cost maintenance peace of mind.

The BMW may be #1 in a couple of categories which is MOST important to SOME ELLPS buyers.  To many other ELLPS buyers the value equation may be more important.  Long term reliability and repair frequency and cost are very important to me as I buy cars for cash and keep them for at least 6 years, some longer.  I want a peppy, luxurious, smaller car that I don't have to have repaired frequently once the warranty is gone(or before for that matter) and I like a nice handling car but I don't need one that I can zip around the cloverleafs at 70mph....50 is fine thank you.So BMW can be #1 for some people but for many it is much farther down the list for a number of valid reasons.  Nobody is arguing that it is not #1 in cutting corners.  So to say a certain car is ""loser"" or always #2 is ridiculous as it is #1 to the thousands that buy it.

I have been away for about 250 posts and finally got enough time to mostly catch up with the posts that have piled up over the past 5 or 6 weeks or so.It seems that we're ""arguing"" (in the best sense of the word) over Infiniti being perpetually number two or Acura this or Hyundai that, 6-speed manual this vs 8-speed tip or step-troic that.

So I got to thinking, ""if"" BMWs were actually priced to lease (or whatever form of financing you choose to use) for $199 or $299 or even $399 per month (in other words, equal to or less than the ""price per"" that everything else is -- in the class we go on about here) would there even be any market left for Acura's, Audi's, Infiniti's, and all the rest?In other words, are we all (or almost all) frustrated BMW owners who ""rationalize"" not having them by using the code word ""value?""  Most of us who have the cars classed as ELLPS or even ELLPS-wanna be's (the Genesis, perhaps?) could affordanyone of the cars herein discussed -- but choose not to go for the most expensive (assuming for a moment that means BMW) because they want to have that new home theater, children, Italian (or where ever) vacations or larger investment accounts.Who actually speaks the words, ""I settled for an X-place (anything less than 1st) car,"" assuming they did not get a BMW? Hmm, well, I would have rather had an A4, A6 or an Infiniti M than an Acura TL -- but I factored in ""opportunity cost"" (and in my case I'll call it monthly payment on a 36 month lease term).  If the other cars on my short list had been offered at the same monthly lease payment, I probably would not have considered the TL.But, hell, if I could get an Audi S8 for $541 a month for 36 months, that's the one I would go for (I might even ""settle"" for an S6, just because I perceive the S6 probably handles better.)So, after reading nearly 250 posts in rapid fire progression, I have decided that ""we"" don't settle, we don't all ""wish"" we could have had a BMW; we just got something different because we do not think monolithically. Those who have BMWs have settled, perhaps, for higher payments or lower durability or quicker acceleration, better performance, higher or lower fuel economy, or whatever the facts support.Those who settled for the [perhaps mythical] $199 per month for 18 months Infiniti G, got, um, more money in their investment accounts or in their money clips -- who knows.I, for one, now have several friends or associates who have eschewed re-upping for another BMW in favor of a Genesis or Equus despite the Korean's inability to blow the doors off of an M5 or 7 seriese or S class.  I wish there would be a place to see just how many ""conquests"" are made by a Genesis or Equus -- my friends experiences, even if their choices were significant data points, are pretty much just anecdotes.I'm thinking, now that I have but 22 months to go on my lease, that I will get an S6, assuming they cost no more than $599 per month for 36 months.

The Integra was definitely based upon the Civic.Part of the problem/dilemma with Acura over the years is that they have not put enough distance between themselves and Honda in the engineering and product positioning of their vehicles.  Both Lexus and Infiniti put a much bigger gap between themselves and their respective roots.  Acura stuck with Honda based FWD and V6's, even in their top of the line cars; and as a result has had to fight the perception that the Integra, Legend, TL and even RL were simply gussied up Honda's.  It wasn't until the 2007 MDX that it wasn't simply a well equipped, face-lifted Pilot.  Lexus had that problem with the ES - a gussied up Camry - but the GS and LS had no Toyota counterpart and were made in Japan.  The early G20 was a Sentra based car, but at least eventually evolved into its own identity with RWD.  The M and Q were non-Nissans.The good news for Acura is that Honda is a better starting point than Nissan and Toyota, in my opinion.  But they seemed to have bi-polar disorder in trying to establish a true luxury division and then chickening out when it came to competing with BMW and Mercedes.  They could have, IMO.Off subject, the best engineered car, dollar for dollar, I have ever owned was my 2002 Honda S2000.  RWD, 120hp/liter without turbos, as tight of a suspension as a Porsche.  I just wish they had more balls to put some of their engineering prowess into something that competed with a 550i 6-speed manual.  Or, just introduce a Honda S3000 so I have something to consider before I buy another Porsche.  The upcoming NSX is over the top in stylistic craziness and will, I predict, be a non-event.

The later 827 improved the situation but not enough.We still get Honda Legend over here too.  Last one I saw was last year, (maybe longer), on a dealer's forecourt. 10 miles on the clock and a price reduced by just 50%, yes 50% !  Salesman said he was prepared to haggle and would let it go if he could show a £100 profit.  Not terribly popular, (3,5 ltr V6), but a wonderful piece of engineering.  Last one I saw on the road was a friend's in Austria, three years ago.  Superb ride but thirsty."

3492,habitat1,"September 18, 2012 4:10AM","There seems to be a theme here that more gears is better.  I disagree.  Ranking the transmission options in a 335i, I'd put it at:#1:  6-speed manual#2:  7-speed dual clutch automatic (""auto-manual"")#3:  8-speed Steptronic (torque converter ""slush box"")Even the suggestion that an 8-speed Steptronic is better than a 6-speed is a little questionable.  I recall when BMW responded to Lexus introduction of 8-speed autos with the counter that BMW engine torque bands were wide enough that they didn't want to add more gears to have the car fishing for the right one at a particular speed.  Is the current 8-speed Steptronic a response to the EPA  in trying to eek an extra mpg out of the engine?  Just like the not so popular start stop feature.  The 6-speed auto in our X5d has no trouble producing 30 mpg on the highway and accelerating like a (big) V8 from 50 to 80.  I can see where the lower torque 3.5i might benefit with 2 extra gears, but the X5d doesn't need them.What's next, a 10-speed auto that has to shift 9 times to get you to a highway cruise?  Or worse, a CVT transmission with an ""infinite"" number of equivalent gear ratios?  At least when Porsche made their EPA concession, it was by adding a 7th gear to their manual that was a pure overdrive.  They left the first 6 ratios untouched.  The engine redlines in 6th gear at 188 mph (top speed) and the ratios are perfectly matched to get every ounce of performance out of the engine.  That's what's important.  And should be to BMW.  Not playing a who's got more game with Lexus."

With that being said, the 8 spd works will with the turbo 4, I haven't driven the turbo 6 with the 8 spd, but I would assume it would be a nice fit too.In regards to the 7 spd manual in the 911, I'm sure BMW will be moving to this soon to get their manual cars into line with the EPA too.I like the newer DCT a lot, very quick shifting up and down, and no lag when shifted"

Very different in terms of design, performance - and cost.  $2,900 for the BMW, $4,000 for the PDK, $10,000 for Ferrari.  You aren't going to get that level of engineering or construction by checking a $450 box with BMW or VW.As for my manual shifting speed vs. a DCT.  That's not the issue.  I'll give up a tenth or two in the 0-60 (one shift) drag race in order to get the direct control and the engagement factor of driving the car.  I understand that's a personal choice.  I'm no Bubba Watson, but I still play golf from the tips of a 7,100 yard course because I want the full effect.  I know I could score a few strokes better from the white tee box, but it wouldn't be as satisfying.  It makes me laugh that some of my playing partners will spend $500 on a driver and then moan like babies when I suggest we play the black tees rather than the blues or whites.Regarding the X5d, the flat torque curve is precisely why you don't need as many gears.  Every gear change results in energy loss.  Small, but a loss nonetheless.  By the time you get to highway speeds, the final gear ratio is all that matters, not how many shifts it took to get there.  Around town, an extra gear or two might help, but a 5,300 pound curb weight is still the overriding factor."

Even though we know that Nissan is working overtime to perfect it, they have come a long way with the new Generation Altima and Infiniti JX, but to see a CVT in a true performance car, Nissan has it's work cut out for themselves."

Limited ""trim"" choices and color choices with almost no options to begin with.  Find a dealer with a big inventory that has great deals.  Other brands, with long option lists, are a little tougher.  But, my recent experience with BMW proved to me that custom ordering from a dealer - which I always assumed meant paying a higher price than taking a car off the lot - may in fact produce the best results, long term.  We had to shop around to a dozen or more dealers to find one that still had allocation spots for a 2012 X5d, but in the end, found one willing to negotiate a price that was within a few hundred (compared to invoice) of the best deal we could have gotten for a ""leftover"" vehicle on the lot.  But, by ordering to our exact specs, we also didn't get stuck with a few options we didn't want, which ended up putting us ahead in the end.If and when I get another ""fun"" car, I will in all likelihood order a Porsche rather than take one of the lot.  Trying to find my color and option preferences, given the ridiculous list of choices from Porsche, is a near fruitless exercise.  And I'd rather shop around for a dealer willing to give me a 6-7% discount on a custom order than compromise my preferences to take a car off the lot (like I did in 2005) at a 11% discount, but one that had a lot of options that I didn't want and didn't have a couple that I now know I would like.A friend of mine who used to work for Audi (corporate, not dealer) indicated that, even though Audi is achieving record sales and many dealerships are low on inventory, you can still order one at or below invoice due to incentives and their desire to continue to increase sales vs. BMW and Mercedes.There is a saying in my business (real estate development) that a great deal on a fair property is not as good as a fair deal on a great property.  For my friend that got lucky with a 535i manual transmission, he got the best of both worlds.  But for most of us, I think I'd rather shop really hard for the car I wanted, and not be stuck with my third or fourth choice color and the wrong options for the next 6-7-8+ years."

However, the Infiniti M was scratched off his list very early. After an interesting week in Charlotte on my way home (have to love WiFi while flying) my partner tells me he finally chosen a car and will tell me about it after he picks me up at the airport. So for the next 3 hours I was trying to figure out what it was, so upon arriving in phoenix I narrowed it down to 3, Hyundai Genesis 3.8, Ford Taurus (eco boost 2.0L, 2013) and lastly VW Passt SE TDI.  Not too sure why I thought the Hyundai but I did..  After getting my check bagged, I meet him at the usual spot on on the north side arrival by entrance 8. He is hungry, I'm not, had a good dinner on the flight but went out anyhow. So after a few conversation about things that happened with both us, I told which car he decided on...  I get this look and reaction, ""how in the hell did you know..."" I laughed, but wasn't too sure which one, but had to guess again, so I went with the Hyundai, Genesis, turned out not to be the V6, but the V8 4.6. So at dinner he explained why he went with it and it all makes sense.... He loves cars, but not in the same sense as I do, he doesn't drive his cars hard at all...MSRP, $45,798, sale price $37,990, it is a 2012, White with Cashmere leather interior, and for 2012 all 4.6L Genesis came fully loaded. Granted it doesn't handle like a BMW, or have the ""bling"" of the MB or the style of Audi, but what it does have is VALUE... We picked the car up on Sat, and drove up to Prescott, AZ. Have to save, was impressed with the dealership and how smoothly the transaction was and how the salesman went over every item on the car with Rick. I was impressed with how it drove, seats are very comfortable, and handled the mountain roads with no issue. My partner likes BMW's and Audi's, but he couldn't justify the price of a 528 or A6 and he doesn't tackle the round abouts (or jug handles as they are called in Jersey) like I do, but he wanted all the luxury and room in the back seats for his clients. So the out the door price was just little over $40K, not too sure how anyone could pass up this deal (Yes I know some of you would without thinking twice.) The same dealer has a couple of Equus they had one on the showroom, MSRP $61,000, sale price $50K..."

Her priority is luxury and space, as she often is driving clients around and, according to her, the Equus has a back seat that is closer to an S class than an E class in size and comfort.  Her husband, a retired Navy pilot and much more of a driving enthusiast, couldn't be pried out of his older generation M5 with a crowbar.  When he drove the Equus, he picked it apart relative handling, braking and precision relative to the German alternatives.  But she's looking at the comfort, space and VALUE - and willing to give Hyundai a chance.  Plus the dealer is willing to give her the car for an entire week to test drive.My guess is that the Equus will get a few more Infiniti and Lexus buyers to consider it than Audi or BMW buyers, but either way, Hyundai has come a long way since those shaky early years."

My friend with the 535i manual is also a mechanical/nuclear engineer and gave me his interpretation as to why it is critically important that engine parts run at different speeds so as not to have single points of contact during early break in.

3535,habitat1,"August 22, 2012 3:35AM","Thanks for posting that data source - it is a great one to look through.However, not sure how you concluded that the TL's minor facelift has made much of a difference in sales?  The YTD numbers are up slightly (12% +/-) through July 2012 vs. 2011, but they are also now giving away the car with up to $9,000 discounts.  And the slight YTD bump is still nowhere near the sales volume of the worst/last year of the previous model.Here's the grim statistical truth about the Acura TL:2004-2006 Total US Sales:227,461(this is FWD only car, 1st 3 years after 2004 redesign.  Average annual = 75,820.  Up 37% from previous model, which still averaged 58k units last two years of it's ""aged"" design"")2009-2011 Total US Sales:98,906(this in spite of now offering both FWD, AWD models with 2 different engines.  Average annual 32,969;down 57% from previous modeland down over 25,000 average sales from last two years of 2002-2003 model)You can't look at this in any way, shape or form (literally) and not call the 2009 Acura redesign a total screw upfrom a business perspective.  Acura pumped tons of money into producing two drivetrains, two engine variants of the TL and sales ended up getting cut by well more than half thanks to going to Pontiac for aesthetic advice and to raid their chrome stockpile.Even Porsche, for all of their focus on engineering prowess, realizes that looks do matter and has continued to refine the classic 911 style.  But Acura was too smart for their own good, threw the 2004-2008 exterior in the trash and look what it got them."
3536,stickguy,"August 22, 2012 4:46AM","you do have to keep in mind the market was vastly different in 2009-2011, with the recession having a major impact.  Plus of course, strong new competition in the segment.but, even my wife/daughter (who know zippo about cars) when we passed a current gen beak TL said ""wow that is ugly"".the 2004?  my favorite.  I almost bought a 2001 new (great deal, but I was too tall to fit comfortably, though I ended up with a 2000 for my son a few years back, so I have one in the family), and looked at the 2004 when it came out.  IMO< a huge improvement.  Better interior, more room, and also way better looking."
3537,flightnurse,"August 22, 2012 6:30AM","Something else to consider, is Acura more aggressive in it's financing of the TL then ever before? I would have to say, yes. Before Acura (or Honda) really never would deal on their cars, but things  have changed. So if someone is shopping purely on price, this could motivate people to buy a TL over say G even though the exterior isn't as nice at the G."

OK, now I kind of get how if you push the car so that it ""needs"" to apply the left rear brake or right front brake or some combination in order to stabilize the car, you might save a bit of wear -- at the cost of reduced stability.But, if you are not in any situation that might require such an electronic intervention, why would turning the ESP off be helpful?  ABS only comes into play when braking so hard that sliding tires are a possibility, but ABS typically cannot be defeated (it is just always at attention, awaiting to be called upon).  I would think ESP causes no brake wear period if it is never engaged.Seems like turning it off increases the danger of understeer, oversteer and out of control situations (on dry, wet or snow/ice surfaces alike -- albeit at lower speeds the slicker the surface becomes).:confuse:"

Or even when it is not raining or snowing, it is possible to get yourself into an understeering situation or even oversteer before you know it and at that exact moment in time I would doubt someone could react and push the ESP ""on"" button.I'm not too sure you really WANT to live THAT dangerously?!?Do you turn off your ABS too?

This trans trumped all of them, regardless what measurement you use.It downshifts at precisely the moment it needs to (does the same for upshifting, and also double clutches precisely when it needs to.  In addition, it snaps of shifts way faster than I ever thought I could.  It magically seems to know what gear to be in, too.NYC.....my 335i's trans is close in performance, but not quite what the S4 trans can do.If I can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, I won't need a manual."

All of the controls are on the steering wheel or within easy reach.  Handling is outstanding, power and acceleration are very good (this is my first turbo).  Visibility is very good.  The car has a solid feel.  No rattles.  The ride is a little choppy on rough roads, very good otherwise.  I'm getting 30+ on the highway at about 65 mph and around 24 in mixed driving on regular.The phone, radio, NAV, etc. are accessed through the Volvo Sensus system, which works fine once you get past the learning curve.  Our cell phones, iTouch work fine.  The Sensus/NAV screen is not a touch screen.  It's 7 inches.  I wish it was a little larger.  The tach. and speedometer are not backlit.  The interior has that orderly understated look, but, not surprisingly, lacks ""bling"".  Sensus is voice activated and works very well.I got all of the safety features, all of which seem to work as advertised.  Two of the best are adaptive cruise control and active bending Xenon headlights.  I find lane departure annoying, so I've shut it off.  I don't let any of these ""safety nannies"" drive the car for me, but if they can give me a heads up, I'll take it.On the downside are a tight back seat and no spare.  There is an inflation kit in the trunk.  This was almost a deal breaker for me.  The dealer threw in a donut spare, which comes in a fabric zip bag and is strapped down in the trunk, a + $200 option.  This makes a smallish trunk even smaller.Volvo offers the Safe and Secure plan, which covers maintenance and repairs (even brakes) for 5 yrs. or 50,000 miles.  (Tires are not covered under this plan.)The car is very fun to drive and I'm happy with it.  Hope this helps."

3607,fedlawman,"August 7, 2012 6:06PM","I think everything evolves in cycles.For a while (2004 through 2006), Acura was arguably #2 in this segment under BMW. Audi was overshadowed by BMW, Infiniti was showing promise as a Japanese BMW alternative, and M-B wasn't an enthusiasts choice. Cadillac was showing promise and Lexus was failing as a Japanese BMW alternative.Today, Audi is tops and Infiniti is arguable #2 being the best bang-for-the-buck choice in the segment. BMW and Acura have both lost their way (though the Roundel still has clout the cars don't deserve right now). Mercedes has improved quality and handling dynamics, and Cadillac has gained credibility with the Gen2 CTS (and the ATS is looking like a real player). Lexus remains content to do the same old thing and sell a ton of ES and RX 350's.6 years from now, I'm sure the picture will be completely different again."

3609,habitat1,"August 8, 2012 5:08AM","Fedlawman - what's your basis for saying Audi is #1 and Infiniti is #2 in this segment?Audi makes some very nice cars, but for all of the accolades the A6 gets, I don't think of it as an enthusiasts choice.  No manual transmission, very heavy, an AWD system that is FWD biased, etc.  It performs quite well, in spite of all of that, but I still can't think of it as a true drivers car.   And in the performance line of the S4, S5, S6 cars, I would still never put them in the enthusiast's league of the M3 or M5.  More like AMG-lite.If you are saying that Audi is #1 because they are the closest to ""all things for all people"", I'd probably agree.  But they don't get my own blood boiling to dump my Acura TL and buy one tomorrow.On another matter, I think BMW needs to steal some Porsche engineers and put their vehicles on a big diet.  The 550i weighs damn near the same as a Porsche Cayenne SUV.  Which, by the way, dropped 400 lbs in its redesign and the new 911 and Boxster  have also lost a few pounds in the Porsche spa.  Not sure why BMW, ""the ultimate driving machine"" has been so slow to use more aluminum and charge its engineers to do more with less (weight)."
3610,markcincinnati,"August 8, 2012 2:00PM","The Audi A6 quattro on day one was not FWD biased.  It was a 50% 50% set up with a non-reactionary TorSen system.  Torque was able to be shifted instantly F or R -ward based on circumstances.  The non-reactionary system was unique (probably still is since most of the market doesn't use TorSen) since it was said to ""act in real time."" All other systems ""react"" which means there is a slight delay in the transfer of power to the end where it will do the most good.For years the Audi A6 quattro has been REAR WHEEL biased, but still uses a non-reactionary system.The TT, on the other hand, did not start out with the TorSen system, rather it started out with the Haldex system (not that there is anything wrong with that), but it is FWD biased and it is a reactionary system, meaning there is some lag whilst the thing figures out there is a need for power at the opposite end and then shifts power appropriately.The A6, since that is where we started, also can be equipped with a system that is called the sport differential, but you can call it a Torque Vectoring system and you'd be right.  Acura's system is SH-AWD but it is, currently, implemented in its cars with SEVERE FWD bias (95%), and it, too, is reactionary.  Those of you who have the 6-speed auto 305HP V6 TL SH-AWD can attest to the lag time in these reactionary systems by simply putting the transmission in drive and flooring the accelerator.  For an instant (which seems like a second) the steering wheel twitches in your grip while the reaction time passes and the FWD power is shifted aft.Try an Audi S4 or even an A4 -- both, like the A6, with Rear Biased AWD -- floor them -- there is zero torque steer, since the thing is 60% RWD biased and doesn't have to react, since TorSen differentials ""bind in real time.""The new Audi A6 chassis, while still NOSE HEAVY, are much better with respect to weight distribution than they have ever been and somehow Audi has -- perhaps only for a brief 15 minutes of fame, so to speak -- managed to jump to the top of the heap insofar as performance is concerned.And, despite its high price tag, the new S6 is a price performer when compared to both BMW and Mercedes models that can keep up with it.  Yep, Audis have cranked up their prices -- but, if there is such a thing as bang for the buck in the over $60,000 crowd, today that accolade would be earned only by Audi.I still remember my buddy who purchased a new 530 (RWD only) with a Premium Pack option, period.  This was, admittedly 2002.  My Audi A6 was a quattro with the sport package, premium wheels, nav and everything you could get on an A6, including premium paint -- oh yea, and it came with a 4.2L V8.  My Audi was about $2K less.  To even approximate the content (but not the engine) would have put the 530's msrp into orbit.Where was I?  Oh, yea -- A6 quattros have never been fwd biased, and for several years now they have been rwd biased, but with non-reactionary awd (which, admittedly, makes them a bit heavier than the other ELLPS and LPS offerings from Asia, Europe and the US.):P"
3611,tlong,"August 8, 2012 5:46PM","Other than being a bit poor in the snow, my '05 TL was just one of my favorite cars ever.

While I sometimes wish for other cars, I know that if I ditched the TL I'd miss it. I learned that after ditching my '98 A4.When I see newer TLs on the road, I have no desire whatsoever for a newer one. When i see my own model on the road, I still think it's one of the sharper looking cars out there. Acura really screwed up with the redesign."

3613,habitat1,"August 9, 2012 4:47AM","I respect your opinion, but not sure I would agree with it.The A4, as with the TL, requires that you go with AWD to avoid their standard FWD setup.  That's OK if you are comparing to a 328ix, but if the ""P"" in ELLPS is important, I still prefer the driving feel and dynamics of a 50/50 balanced RWD sedan.    And, if you really want AWD and can get by the exterior looks of the TL, it appears to offer significantly better performance than the A4 Quattro.Personally, I don't find Audi's exterior design on the A4 to be that much better than the TL.  The A5 is seriously great looking, the A7 very good, but the A4/A6 still look slab sided and plain/boxy in my opinion.  When I think ""sexy"", the A5 qualifies, but the A4 needs a lot of work.   Even the C-class sedans beat the A4 for exterior looks, IMO.Disclosure:  I haven't driven a new A4 Quattro 6-speed manual.  I am basing performance comparison on what is published and my limited experience with an automatic as a loaner.  But giving up nearly 100hp to the TL and Acura's AWD system (perhaps) being more advanced from a handling perspective, leads me to believe that the A4 would not do well in a track test between the two.  And maybe not against a 328i RWD.But.....sexy is an ""O"", so I do respect your ""IMO""."
3614,fedlawman,"August 9, 2012 8:08AM","I agree the TL has the better powertrain, but a 6MT costs $44K, and for that much money, there are better choices IMO (S4?).And the interior and exterior styling of the Audi is far better (again IMO). Better control layout and material quality in the Audi, and the Audi just goes down the road better (quieter cabin with classic German suspension tuning). It's the only $35k car here that makes you feel like you spent $45k when you're driving it.The AWD TL is the best car Acura sells right now and I agree it's still a contender (I like it better than the G37). But I have to bump Acura down a notch from 6 years ago because as a whole, their lineup isn't very compelling."

3618,habitat1,"August 9, 2012 11:42AM","I am a BMW fan, as evidenced by our imminent pick up of an X5d in early September at the Performance Delivery Center in Spartanburg.  And the 550i is a very nice car in many respects.  But it could - and should - be better yet.The 550i 6MT weighs 4,350+ lbs, goes 0-60 in about 5.0 and gets 15/22 MPG.  The CLS550 is 200 lbs lighter, goes 0-60 in 4.4 and is rated 17/25 MPG.  The E55 AWD is another 115 lbs less than the CLS.When I was vaguely contemplating an M5 in 2002, it weighed 4,000 lbs and with a high revving 400hp/369 ft.lb engine, was a few tenths quicker than the current 550i in spite of giving up 80 ft lbs of torque.  Forget the handling comparison, the old M5 was much more precise, nimble and tossable than the current 550.In the ELLPS, we have seen pretty steady improvements in performance, at not a huge increase in price.  I would expect BMW to have maintained it's dominance with the 550i, but in my opinion, has been slow to put it on a diet and keep it positioned as the clear enthusiast's choice over some of the LPS competition.  At least they do still offer a 6-speed manual.  And maybe the added 40 hp in the performance package for 2013 will help.  But I'd like to see it tip the scales at 3,950.  That's still a half ton more than my beloved 1995 Maxima and only 400 lbs less than a Cayenne SUV.  Come on, BMW, start doing those push ups and get rid of the flab."
3619,flightnurse,"August 9, 2012 1:13PM","I remember it being a very nice car, but like all Honda's, a little less isolated in cabin noise vs. the competition.Hey Fed, for memostHonda products are like appliances, they do what they are suppose to and don't leave a last impression.

I had my choice of Tahoe or transverse. I took the Accord (its been a while since I have driven one) it was an EX. Nothing stood out for me, the driving position, the steering feel, the brakes, the handling.  When one talks about the TL, I hear people talk about the top of the line model, not the entry level or mid level.  The last time I drove a TL was back in 2008 and it was a Type S, nice car, very comfortable seats, but again, not else stood out."
3620,markcincinnati,"August 9, 2012 2:04PM","While I agree that for the price of a TL SH-AWD Advance you could get a BASE Audi S4, the S4 requires over $11,000 of options to get to parity with respect to ""content.""The TL SH-AWD Advance with the a la carte addition of back-up sensors and splash gaurds is north of $47 or $48K depending on how many a la carte do-dads (which are nice) you check off.The TL SH-AWD, however, is able to (mostly) keep up with the S4 (you've no doubt read the test report comparing the two cars, which shows them to have remarkably similar performance -- even though the Audi, in the end, does out-perform the Acura -- for $11,000+ more outlay.)I call the TL SH-AWD Advance, an S4 ""lite"" or perhaps S4-like. Given a price independant choice, I would still, however, take the S4 without any hesitation.I like the [Acura's] 19"" wheels, blind spot warning, the ventilated seats, the best factory sound system ever and the torque vectoring, etc, etc, etc, all of which jack the cost of an S4 way too close to $60,000.I went to Acura from a nearly $49K 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige quattro sport -- the last in a long, long line of Audi products (which I dearly loved.) I wanted the performance of the Audi and the content of the Acura -- for UNDER $50K.  The Acura is outgunned by the S4 (and yet the TL is NOTshamedby the S4), but [the TL Sh-AWD Advance] is priced like an Audi A4 Premium+ with a couple of options on it. And the Acura is ""similar"" in performance to the S4, which I would argue is at the top o' the heap of the desirable car list (that can be afforded by mere mortals.)The TL is ugly, a step up from fugly, but a far cry from the beautiful A4 (IMHO). But once you're behind the wheel of the TL at, ahem, ""highway"" speedslistening to a great DVD-Audio disk, you quickly forget how the face and butt of the TL look.Today, the TL remains an interesting proposition -- perhaps when Acura ""rationalizes"" the entire lineup, improves the styling and so forth, Acura will regain legitimacy in the Premium class.  I await 2014 for some sign from above that they have once again found their way.My hopes are high, but likewise are my doubts that they [Acura] will once again be a legitimate player in the ELLPS and LPS sandbox.  The new RDX and ILX indicate they think they can get away with producing ""Honda's who know someone"" rather than real Premium cars.And, you know what?  If they sell enough of them, it doesn't matter one whit what any of us thinks. With Acura we're kind of at the same place we were (or are) with respect to manual transmissions -- no matter how we cry and whine (here on these boards), manual transmissions are virtually dead because ""no one"" buys them and it costs a lot to get a car certified for sale here in the US -- so why bother when the customer take up on stick shifts which used to be at 3% continues to fall and fall and fall into the abyss.We have voted with our dollars -- and here we are.  :surprise:Drive it like you live."

My comments about Acura really sum up my overall disappointment with the downward spiral of their entire lineup.In 2004 they had the RSX which, while arguably not deserving of the Acura badge, was a terrific sports car (especially in ""S"" trim). Then there was the first gen TSX 6MT. It's ride, handling styling, driveline, etc. had such a synergy that, for me, made it an even match for the BMW 3-series. And the TL in 2004 was lean and mean, with good looks, powerful driveline, and sharp reflexes.Today, the only Acura worth a second glance is the TL SH-AWD. And even their best has polarizing looks (I'm being polite) and an unattractive cockpit with too many buttons (my opinion).For me, even with a bottom-of-the-line A4, you get a handsome, elegant sedan that does no wrong. Now I'll admit that I'm not a bells and whistles kind of guy, so i don't care if my car has back up cameras, Nav, and surround audio. Hell, I even prefer cloth and pleather to genuine cowhide!Oh well, I'm just one enthusiast with admittedly unconventional tastes. And I've admitted before that I became alienated from this segment several years ago when I discovered the joys of E30's.Thank you and Habitat for setting the record straight on the SH-AWD - I did do it a disservice by not mentioning it in my initial comment."

That kind of blows the 1 in 6305 out of the water for 2012.  I've been told that manual transmissions on the TL this year are running about 3%, which would make it 33 to 1. Or 190 to 6305.It is a shame in my opinion.  The TL manual gets an 8.5 out of 10 on my scale for crisp feel, short throw.  Behind my S2000 (rate 9)  and 911S (rate 10), but ahead of all non-M BMW's, all Audi's, and the G37.  Just rating the gearbox, mind you, not the car.  On the other hand, the TL (and MDX) automatic gets a 3 on my rating scale.  Way too much lag time and mushiness in response.

They were all very, er, ubiquitous.""Now I used to think I was pretty astute at discerning what I was looking at -- but today I saw a new Passat SEL that must've had some optional glitzy wheels and a beige leather interior (I assume it was real cow, that is).  I thought, for a full second, ""Nice Audi.""I doubt the Passat was more than $35K -- but it LOOKED expensive (assuming you think Audi's look expensive.)Nothing about a TSX looks expensive to me -- but what the hell do I know, I bought a 2012 Acura TL (not to imply I think the TL looks expensive, but from the outside it looks less like a Honda than the TSX.)What do I know?Drive it like you live.  :surprise:"

I happen to have an old Kelly Blue Book that I pull out occasionally as a reminder of how crazy things were in the ""old days"".  Here are some base price stats that show what the decade from1985 to 1995looked like by comparison:1985 Mercedes 190E - $23,7301995 Mercedes C220 - $32,000Increase = 34.9%1985 BMW 325e - $21,700.1995 BMW 325i - $34,120.Increase = 57.2%1985 Nissan Maxima SE - $13,6991995 Nissan Maxima SE - $22,989Increase = 67.8%1985 Honda Accord LX - $10,8241995 Honda Accord LX - $18,880Increase = 74.4%1985 Porsche 911 Coupe - $31,9501995 Porsche 911 Coupe - $63,055Increase 97.4%A few takeaways from this analysis:(1)  It's pretty amazing how modestly prices have gone up in the 17 years since 1995.  If they had continued to climb at the 1985-1995 pace, a BMW 328i would now have a base price of $73,600 and a 911 Coupe would be a mere $200,400.(2)  Back in the ""old days"", even a bottom of the line BMW or Mercedes was a relatively rare symbol of status, costing over twice as much as a Honda Accord or 70% more than a ELLPS Maxima.  When I bought a 1995 Maxima SE, the 325i was over 50% more.  Today, the base price of a 328i is only $5,000 more than the base price of a 325i 17 years ago.  And only a similar amount more than a Maxima.Draw your own conclusions as to what this means relative to ELLPS today.  Frankly, I think a lot of people today are stretching to get themselves into a BMW, Audi or Mercedes when, back in 1985, or even 1995, they would have not even considered it and had to ""settle"" for a Honda Accord or maybe Nissan Maxima.  I'm not so sure that was a bad thing."

My automotive condolences to you.I've never driven a TL SH-AWD, but know its got some chops from what I've read.  What'd you think of the brakes compared to the BMW?  I don't track or race my car, just looking for a little fun on my 6 day/week commute like I did with my 2001 Prelude Type SH for the 1st 9 years of its life.  I wasn't ""getting it"" from the 2010 TSX I inherited from my wife (lifeless electric power steering, crummy brakes).  I love my 2011 328xi.  I just don't know if the new F30 328xi will be worth it so sparsely equipped as I ""built"" last night.  Especially when a TL SH-AWD Tech comes loaded for a similar sticker.

I believe the 2012 TL SH-AWD 6-speed manual does as well.  In my car, they are great, and way, way better than the crappy brakes on our MDX or the automatic TL's I was given as service loaners.  My 2004 is FWD, so it has all of those performance pitfalls, but is still a reasonably fun car.I would never seriously consider or recommend an automatic or FWD TL over a BMW.  The 6-speed manual TL-SHAWD might be worth a test drive for you to make the call yourself.  Interestingly, I was NOT very favorably impressed with  2011/2012 535i 6-speed manuals.  I wasn't seriously in the market, but when we were shopping for the X5, was being tempted by some great deals.

Of course this is confusing or could be to anyone who knows the way the car biz names things -- X's typically mean cars that are ALL WHEELS DRIVEN (328ix, M37X, X6, FX56 and so forth.)Also, for those shopping this apparent class of car, the transmission choices should never include fewer than 6 speeds and often what is needed to be compared with the best is 7 or 8 speeds (and, if possible a 6 speed stick.)If one of your key features and differentiators has been SH-AWD, Torque Vectoring, or whatever that special secret sauce is, dumbing down the line also is a way to telegraph you're place on the Premium Class pecking order is falling not rising.I suspect Acura does OK financially due to the popularity of the MDX.  The dealer I use in Columbus had dozens and dozens of MDX's and not much of anything/everything else.  I swear I saw no RL's of any MY, no ZDX's (but I really think that the ZDX is dead and no one has been informed, yet), a few ILX's and a few RDX's.I have no issue with Acura making a decision to slide gracefully out of, off of the Premium Class list -- and maybe that is what is being done.  Somehow it seems, however, that they're oblivious to what is going on around them.I used to think of Acura as the Japanese Audi -- no more.  In fact I can't seem to find any descriptive term that fits the line.

That's overall true.However, that recipe (powerful motor, technologically top of class, premium ride/handling, premium build/materials, for less money than the Germans) doesn't seem to be on Acura is following any more.I don't know if they can't build that anymore, or they choose not to.  But, regardless of the classification, they still build good cars.Frankly, I've seen all the Japanese marks falter a bit since the tsunami and resultant nuke meltdown occurred.  Who knows?  It could take another decade for the likes of Honda/Acura, Nissan/Infiniti, Toyota/Lexus to recover.I would say that maybe Acura hasn't kept pace with the other Lux/performance cars we've talked about here.  But, I contend they're  still good cars (i.e. your TL SH AWD).I know they would have kept me in the fold if the current TL would have kept pace with the Germans.  So far, not even the newly released Lexi, Acura, and Infinitis have been able to do that.You want to see, feel, hear where the money goes in the premium you pay for BMWs and Audis, listen to the drivetrain, test the suspension, notice the ride/handling balance, look at the premium materials they use, and the solidity of their build.  That's where you can tell the biggest differences.Obviously, you already know this since you've owned the German brands."

The 3.6 engine seemed enthusastic in its sounds and refinement but was unable to press you back in the seat at full throttle.  The feeling in the CTS was ""same day service.""The CTS lacked the driver and passenger above-door handles that even the least expensive VW's offer -- and it's not like passengers would have no use for them. This symbolically told me where Cadillac's head was, and that is Cadillac's head is up its nose!Now, for the money (not MSRP, lease money per month, that is) the pecking order (from low payment to high) was Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, Cadillac CTS/4 Premium Luxury and the S4 (Prestige).  At these respective levels of trim each of the three offered about the same content (although the Cadillac didn't have blind spot monitoring which seems like a glaring oversight.)If Acura is trying to compete with Infiniti, I know of none of their cars that offers the performance level, interior poshness or HP for the buck offered by Infiniti.I do like my Acura (which is $547/mo for 36 months) -- I am not crazy about the styling (exterior) and there is very little ""premium"" anything in the interior except the heated and ventilated seats -- the 2012 Acura does a decent impression of my 2005 Audi A6 (which had the +sized wheels and tires, but no sport suspension, but w/sport seats) -- and the SH-AWD allows the TL to perform ""similarly"" to an Audi S4 (S4-Lite, i.e.)Rumors are rumors and who knows what is real -- so I am planning on keeping my mind open about a 2014 TLX, Cadillac ATS/4, Audi A? and both the G and M Infiniti's.I am looking for my next car to have what appears to be the reliability and durability of my '12 Acura and my wife's '11 Infiniti (and the performance of at least an Audi A4 in terms of handling.) The Audi may have to be removed from my list, in fact, due to my suspicions that virtually any German car on the market (and I have had 29 of them) shows and feels its age more quickly than the Japanese (and maybe even than the Cadillac, I have no experience with that.)I priced out an ATS/4 with the turbo four and premium pack -- it turned out to be just south of $50K -- with a 6 speed auto.  Word is there will be an 8-speed auto ""soon.""  Might be worth a look-see.If the greatest gripe I have is that the lesser TL's have no place on either the ELLPS or LPS boards, but that the top o' the line SH-AWD version is decent -- well, I think we all are in pretty good shape with any of these vehicles if configured to match one's proclivities.Still, 2014 can't come soon enough!  :surprise:"

I'd probably look at a Q5 over the RDX, too.Now then, offer up the SH-AWD on the RDX and it becomes the pick of the litter since it would be a bargain, or at least one would think it ought to be.For the record, as if there is a record, I do not track my cars -- I look at SH-AWD as both a performance improvement on regular roads and a safety feature considering the understeering habits of virtually all FWD and non-SH-AWD, AWD versions.Drive it like YOU live!"

I can say this with a straight face since the '09 A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport and ADS was about $120 more per month than the TL.Don't confuse my rationalization as anything but ""driving it the way I lived -- at the time I entered into the transaction.""  I was looking for something that I could live with, feel safe and comfortable with and that had decent performance -- AND was a prudent choice during a crappy economy.Still, however, I think 2014 can't come soon enough (for Acrua at least.)

3668,markcincinnati,"August 1, 2012 6:02PM","Warped rotors make a sound and usually a feel.  The term that describes the feel is shudder or shuddering.  The sound that is made will remind you of the sound you hear when your ABS brakes are activated.  The ABS could be said to pulse rapidly -- typically the warp sensation although similar to the pulsing sensation of ABS is somewhat more violent.The higher the speed the more the shuddering is noticeable and the louder it is too.  As the warp becomes more and more severe, the onset of the shuddering is at lower and lower speeds.  Mine was seemingly cured by the rotors being resurfaced or turned as it is called.Some rotors cannot be turned without serious longentivity issues.  Acura claims their rotors are thick enough to withstand up to three turns.The price of the rotors at an Acura dealer (front pair) installed is about $350 for new Acura replacements.Acura's brakes are fine for most normal driving, but they seem a bit delicate and are not fans of heat (not that any rotors are, it's just that Acura's seem particularly prone to disliking heat.)  I can't imagine having this car in the mountains or living with mountains with brakes as intolerant of heat as these.I have no idea why (other than $) a more durable or heat tolerant rotor is not used, especially when we're probably talking about a relatively small  $ number to set the car up with bullet proof brakes.My wife's BMWs and my most recent Audis had excellent brakes -- I know they're out there."

We can fool ourselves into ""Oh - I can negotiate a good discount and with a nice trade I don't even have to look at real price"", but the truth is today it is hard to find something decent below forty grand...

At that moment in history, the Genesis lease was $299 per month.  His decision Genesis and his thoughts are ""if possible"" to pay $299 per month ""forever"" and always have a new or nearly new car.Sure you can (I did) argue that there is no comparison between a 550 and the Genesis.  Well, this guy, far as I can tell, could afford virtually anything without a second thought probably into the low 6-figures.  But the depreciation was taking the fun out of owning, so he switched to leasing, then even that wasn't much fun anymore, especially when he swears he has given up ""oh so little"" to have that new Genesis; well, he has given up the high cost.I dunno, maybe its the hangover from the Great Recession, maybe its the phase of the moon -- or climate change.The prices keep going up, that much is certain.What also is happening is that few companies own airplanes either -- they rent them (and there is at least some argument that would justify buying a jet -- since they are practically rebuilt annually.)The glut of cars, the economy and people feeling they don't want to drive yesterday's news seems to be pressing ""us"" to drive younger and younger cars, despite their breath-taking drop in value.I'll tell you how crazy this is, if you don't think cross shopping a 550 with a Genesis is crazy enough, my commercial banker neighbor went from a V12 Mercedes full sized coupe to a Sonata (again, not for any lack of ability on his part to front the money.)Maybe he just didn't want to be considered part of the 1%.Hell it's hot.  :confuse:"

A road test done in isolation is good for a general overview of a car, but unless it is a comparison test with other cars, it is of limited value.A comparison test is better because memory of the cars is fresh and the venue, conditions, etc. are the same, making for a more accurate review. But still, all people are influenced by expectation bias and so there is no such thing as an unbiased and impartial road test.In the end, in choosing a car, you have to take in all the info and facts that are out there, test drive the car (hopefully long enough to discover the nits like the glare on the instruments when the sun is at certain angles, or that pressure point in the seat back that you won't notice until an hour of driving) and make a decision. With cars of this caliber, it will often be a decision of value, comfort, and aesthetics more than sheer performance.As for the ATS, until I see and drive it in person and see some instrumented performance testing alongside it's peers (same day, same track), I will reserve judgement on it."

The car has lived up to its reputation of being ""perfect"" from a mechanical perspective -- I would assume this car would soldier on for years and years and 100's of thousands of miles with nothing but regular maintenance.  This is the first car I have ever owned that seems to be deft at hiding the miles it shows on the odometer (20,000+ in 11 months). The Germans I have had showed their age unless they were ""over maintained.""In fact there has only been one -- troubling -- issue with the car.  The front brakes at 8,000 miles were warped (and ""turned"" as part of the warranty.) Again at 20,000 miles the tell-tale shuddering of warped rotors returned and they were again resurfaced.  Today, two days after the resurfacing, the brakes feel ""the way they should"" in my opinion.While the car was in for an oil change, tire rotation and brake resurfacing, my loaner car was a 2012 TL Tech.  Not AWD, not Advance -- simply a nice 3.5L FWD TL with the tech package.Previous loaners have always been new MDX's -- I can't remember when I actually had driven a TL that was not AWD and not Advance, in fact.To cut to the message: I get out of my TL and into the FWD TL and motor off to run errands and drive all over the city of Columbus, OH for a few hours -- my first thought within one mile, ""this car is a sofa.""  Had they given me a Lexus instead?OK, here's my impression -- the TL FWD falls over its tires, i.e., understeers easily, has torque steer aplenty and is unimpressive for a car that probably lists (as my loaner was) close to $40K. There is no way it belongs in any discussion -- while keeping a straight face -- called Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans.  It feels like an Accord or a Camry (or perhaps Avalon) for pity's sake. The steering is way overboosted and there doesn't appear to be any device affixed to the thing that provides any resistance to the massive body roll and exacerbated understeer this thing is capable of demonstrating.No wonder all the good stuff written about the TL (for 2012) is about the SH-AWD Advance version -- without that level of trim, the thing is practically a joke with respect to ""performance"" entry level or other-wise.I had no idea the difference would be so pronounced.While I was there, I looked at the new RDX -- now without SH-AWD (good looking, upscale Honda CRV, NO SH-AWD, what were they thinking?) and the ILX -- better looking than a Civic but with a puny engine and 5 speed automatic, again it makes me wonder ""what were they thinking?""The TL, as mine is configured when driven back to back with an Audi S4, made me think, the TL was (for the money) an S4-lite (or S4 like) for $11,000+ less money.Going from the German cars I have been used to in my garage since 1978 to the TL was, with this model, not terribly difficult.  It does appear that Acura needs to really step up its game to be in the ELLPS crowd.  As of my day in the life this weekend, I would say Acura is on probation to remain a member of this group.2014 can't come soon enough!  :shades:"

Apparently, Nissan has seen the success of the BRZ and decided that's the direction they were going.The problem, where does that leave the G?  They already tried to move it down in the food chain with a smaller motor, and failed at it.  They can't move it up, as the M resides there (which has also been pretty dismal).  Maybe Infiniti becomes strictly an SUV marketer?  They've had success there."
3702,graphicguy,"July 13, 2012 6:59AM","cdn.....couldn't agree more.  That ""start/stop"" feature is probably minuscule in fuel/emissions savings.  Start up is when the most emissions are emitted.  So, now a BMW triples or quadruples the amount of starts its cars are creating.Add to that, the additional complexity, it becomes an answer to a question no one asked.But, you're right.  They didn't care about the run flat tires, or no more oil dipsticks (in fairness, they aren't the only ones).  So, this half baked and implemented feature with the ""Start/stop"" feature isn't likely to  get them to change directions.Maybe that's what people want?

Could be the 2.0 at 115bhp but unlikely to be anything more exotic.  0-60 for that bunch is, indeed, in the 11 to 12 seconds bracket.The other engines on offer in our Mondeo are 2.0 TDCi's with either 140 or 175bhp; the latter showing circa 8.4secs for 0-60.  However, 0-60 dashes are not what diesels are about, really.  Economy, stressless driving, good mid-range punch, (40-70 is usually pretty fair).

So, now your steaming hot, and the car won't restart because the battery was depleted by the A/C.Usually, car companies think things through more thoroughly than BMW has thought this ""start-stop"" feature through.

I also agree with you that if more people (not the guys here on the board), drove vehicles with manual transmissions that they'd pay more attention to their everyday driving habits.  I used to heavily criticize many things on these boards many moons ago (I think I signed on in '99) from AWD to Automatic Transmissions.Automatics WERE terrible.  My 1st car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT w/ a 3 speed automatic (garbage), my 2nd car was a 1998 Ford Explorer Sport with a 5 speed automatic that shifted slow & violently.I LOVE my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH equipped with a slick shifting, 5 speed manual transmission.  I DID NOT appreciate the bill I got to replace the clutch, friction plate, & throw out bearing at only 52,000 miles.My 328xi is an automatic w/ AWD.  It's our 2nd BMW with AT & AWD (1st was my wife's 2007 X3).  Manuals have been an $800 or so option for a number of years on the Corvette.  Yes they are somewhat of a compromise, but that margin is getting slimmer & slimmer every year.I'd like to teach my children (5.5, 3, & 7 months) to drive stick and have their 1st car equipped with a manual transmission.Speaking of ""driver skills,"" I put the brakes to the test on my BMW this morning.  About 3/4 mile away from my house, I'm on a straight section of a curvy road.  I see a TSX that took the corners so badly he was heading straight towards me.  I jumped on the brake pedal (there was nowhere to go) and those BMW clamped down & stopped IMMEDIATELY!  This would have not been an offset front end collision, this would have been a straight head on collision.  If I had left 1 second earlier, not come to a full & complete stop @ the stop sign by my house... WOW!

3752,graphicguy,"June 22, 2012 12:12PM","nyc....Glad to hear you're OK.  BMW's brakes are excellent, as you found out.When my son turned 15, I taught him to drive on a manual transmission, not an automatic.  I still had my track Mustang at the time and was irregularly taking it to the local track.  And, I took him to Mid-Ohio for autox (myself and a friend set up and drove a Toyota FX16 there).Did any of it make him a better driver?  I don't know.  Those first couple of years,  he actually had more tickets and accidents than I did at the same time in my driving career.And, when he got the chance, he went for an automatic vs a manual transmission car.The benefit of manual trans, if there is one, has faded over the years.  First, the manual trans was used because they offered better fuel economy.  That's simply not true today (with rare exceptions).As many of us can testify here (including yourself), today's automatics are miles away from where they used to be.On the track, or the highway, there's no way I can shift as quickly as the S-Tronic can.  I hit the paddle shifters and the shift is firm and immediate.The auto/manual trans in your BMW, it will be in the right gear, at the right time, and do it quicker than you can.That offers more control over the car, not less.The higher up the performance and price ladder you go, the fewer and fewer manual transmissions you'll see.  As was pointed out before, even Ferraris and Lambos are now sporting ""manumatics"".  Most would agree that those are at the top of the heap when it comes to personal performance cars.Maybe somebody can make another thread to talk about manual transmissions, as in here, this has become derailed.kd....couldn't agree with you more."

It was a ""3 on the tree"".  Then I graduated to an F-150, with the long throw (and I do me looonnnnnng throw) floor shifter, in which you had to guess which gear it might end up.  It might have had synchros at some point in its life.  But they were gone by the time I jumped into the driver's seat.  Lots of double clutching on that truck.Lots of control offered with those.... :P"
3760,gogiboy,"June 23, 2012 10:35AM","GG--This little dust-up reminds me of a debate that descended into a verbal assault over on Edmunds ""Inside Line"".  As often happens someone gets critical--even nonsensical over some perceived problem with a technology or car, in this case the new Scion/Subie joint venture.Anyway, this anti-Scion poster argued vehemently (one could almost imagine the spittle on his computer screen) that no car could be called a sports car with only 200 HP as if that as the only measure of a sports car could be distilled into one number divorced from all other driving characteristics.  No amount of argument from others would sway him from his position.  I liked it when another poster pointed out that by that narrow definition no Austin Healey, MG, Triumph, Fiat, etc--all mid-60s icons of sportiness-- could be classified as a sports car.Alas, neither would my 92 MR2 with only 140 HP, but it always feels like a sports car to me (and GG I whisper this: it has a manual)Gogiboy"
3761,stickguy,"June 23, 2012 3:00PM","interesting question about HP.  Thinking back, I am pretty sure the only ones I have had are my 2000 Acura TL (really my son's car) and my wife's Odyssey.Maybe the 1970 Nova I briefly had (never registered that dog).  I know it had a V8, but no clue how much HP it had than (or ever!).So of cars that I actually plated and drove, probably just those 2.  Had a 1998 Maxima SE, but that only had 190 I think.  But was quick."

3764,gogiboy,"June 24, 2012 12:43PM","GG--I'm still hanging around--not too much posting. I guess I'm spending too much time in the studio and with my dogs.I see where the Subie/Scion Twins were #1 and #2 for shortest time on dealer lots for May (4 days and 5 days respectively), which makes sense given their recent release.I mentioned on Sales Stories that I looked at a Scion frs on the lot of my local dealership.  It's a good looking car from the outside, but the interior looks rather cheap to me.  I think it's in keeping with the ""driver's car"" philosophy being espoused by Toyota (and it's probably keeping the cost down).  The one on the local lot lasted close to three weeks before it sold.  I haven't seen it around town yet although it might have  been purchased by someone from OKC or Tulsa since they are only 60 miles away and the pricing is fixed with Scion so buyer's will pay the same anywhere.  Actually, I say that and I know my local dealership doesn't play any mark-up games so maybe it's a better deal if some of the dealers are charging a surcharge for these high-demand cars.By the way congrats on the Audi.  My brother did a similar move last winter, but reversed the brands.  They own an Audi Allroad and he just added a new BMW X-3 to their stable.  His wife drives the Allroad and he drives the X-3.  Interestingly, he went from a BMW 3 series to a Honda Element to the X-3, which strikes me as a bit auto schizophrenic.Gogiboy"

Since MB will be bring the GLK blue tec diesel over for 2013. I haven't heard about a X3 Diesel..Yes, the Q5 is a very nice SUV, well built very solid. But pricey."

If/when that happens, he's looking at minivans in pretty short order.Trade market is strong.  Pulling the trigger on the S4 was predicated on me kicking in some money for the SO.  That meant getting decent $$$$ for the Accord.  And, for her to sell her '03 Subie Outback, which she's putting in for some minor repairs (CV joints, A/C check and charge) before hitting the newspaper ads.May have another Sales story regarding selling the Subaru shortly.

I will say the ""downgrade?"" to the NSx could not be a better more exotic pick. Make sure you get the manual because I think the auto was slower and had less hp(maybe its just my bias towards stick, but I think this may be true).  Love the NSx - the end of it coincidently ended Acura as a cheap lux sport brand it was previously known- now its just Hondas Buick line.

3779,graphicguy,"June 18, 2012 5:16AM","Thanks all.  Appreciate the good wishes.How does it drive?  I'll compare it to the 335i.  Well, that really isn't fair, given you can change the driving characteristics with ""Driver Select"" on the S4.  But, I left it in ""Dynamic"" mode on the drive back from Chicago, which is the most agressive tuning.Steering is lighter than the BMW at low speeds, but tightens up nicely and linearly as the speeds increase.  A smidgeon less feel of the road at low speeds (like when parking), spot on feel at speed.  Given the rear wheel drive bias, and the torque vectoring, there wasn't a speed I was afraid to attack a corner.  I'm sure there were limits, but only because of the tires (which have high limits to begin with).The sales person (who was a huge enthusiast) suggested I test the ""launch mode""....essentially, turning off trac control, rev the engine while foot is firmly on the brake, then release the brake.  All 4 wheels hook up and WOW, I was literally launched, like a sling shot.  Again, didn't have a stop watch.  But, I would imagine if you're into stop light wars, unless you're staring at a 'vette, or a high buck exotic along side of you, you won't lose many of those.Flinging into a corner, the S-tronic shifts down with a blip to rev match and then powers out the other end as you exit.  Impressive.As mentioned, it's more comfortable than my 335i, and has more room. Interior is gorgeous.  Materials and build are all very high quality (even compared to my 335i, which isn't a slouch in that dept, at all).On a side note about tires, while we didn't buy the car we test drove, there was a difference between it, and the one we bought.......the tires.  The test car had all season sports tires (Y rated).  The one we eventually bought, had summer only tires.  The GF, after driving both cars, decided she wanted the all seasons.The dealer agreed on the swap at no charge.  Apparently, the all-seasons were a special order on a car in which the sale fell through.  So, they were using it as a demo.  But, it only had about 100 miles on it.  I'm sure if you would track the car, you could tell the difference between the summer tires and the all-seasons.  But, I couldn't.I mentioned previously, I got between 28-29 MPG on my 335i on all highway driving.  There wasn't much in the way of break-in recommendations for the S4 in the manual (don't redline it or slam on the brakes in the first 500 miles).  We cruised home to SW OH on a tankful, getting 26 MPG in the S4, on a green motor, driving anywhere from 70-80 MPH the entire way.  That included some in-town, stop and go in the city, too.  I'm thinking the S4 should match the 335i once the engine loosens up a bit.To be continued......"
3780,driver100,"June 18, 2012 5:25AM","VW product, and he'd get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off MSRP). I had that in my pocket.To be continued.....Great story GG.  I can't wait to hear the rest.  By the way, that is a beautiful car.  I hope you print your story on sales frontlines too.Briefly, we were going to trade in my wife's 2008 335Xi BMW for a 2013 328 or 335ix.  We went on Saturday to test them.  I checked the value of our trade in before I left and I got a range of $20,100 for dented one, and $24800 for top condition.  Appraiser gave a value of $20000, said that is what they pay for them at the ""BMW auctions"".btw, the car is in mint condition, new tires, alignment, and 38k miles!We left, I told the salesman his price was good, he would take 5.5% off the new one.  The difference was $42k for the 335 and $36k for a 328.My wife really wants a garage door opener on the mirror, and to get that on a 335 you need to take the navi-camera option which costs $4500.  On a 328 you need 2 options, $1500+$4500.  She doesn't need those.Before we left I said I would pay $40k difference, for the 335.  He said it won't work.We left, I told the salesman, who is excellent, his price on the new one is good, but I am not too pleased with the allowance on the trade in, and I hinted the BMW auction sounds like an excuse to give you a low price.We checked out an Audi dealer on the way home, mainly because I was curious to see how much they would give me for our trade in.  The salesman had a standard 2011 A4 coupe to try (or was it an A5?), and we loved it.  Then we tried a 4 door 2013 Premium Plus automatic sedan, just to make sure the car felt right.Too be continued............."
3781,graphicguy,"June 18, 2012 7:06AM","driver.....We're fortunate to be able to get cars that are so capable as either the BMW or the Audi.  These are cars that are really at the very pinnacle of the lux/sports car round up.  From this point, cars get bigger, heavier, thirstier, etc.Driving a 5 series, or even an E350, you can feel the performance penalties from their smaller siblings.  Now, if that's what you like and want, perfect.  I think most on this board would rather have a faster, more nimble car than what those represent, however.Saw an A7 on the showroom.  Slick looking car.  Even the A6 is a pretty car...inside and out.  Maybe an S6 is something I'd be interested in at some point.  Not right now though.OK.....where were we.Before the GF, my son and I headed out to Chicago, my son and I shopped his (my) Accord at a couple of dealers, including one of the local Audi dealers.  We've all heard the dealers, and their rationale for low balling a trade (wrong color, wrong equipment, soft market for the car, need to wholesale it, etc).  Bottom line, the Accord couldn't be more smack dab in the heart of the plate when it comes to used car desirability.  They're reliable, good on gas (4 cyl, like mine), handle well, built well, will last 200K+ miles if reasonable care is taken.  So, none of those ""reasons"" for low-balling really resonated with me.  And, this particular one had never seen a paint booth or a body shop.  Yes, there are some chips and a couple of dings here and there, but you would have to look hard to find them.  It had good rubber, clean interior, everything worked the way it should, documented oil changes every 5K miles.  All routine maintenance up to date.Locally, I was offered $7.5-$8K....or, about $2,000-$2,500 from what I had researched as the car's trade value was.  My opinion, this would retail for $13K-$15K all day long. Let's say some lot was in a hurry to sell it....$12K would get it gone in a few days, not weeks.  $9,500 was the right number on a trade.GF and I spent a good amount of time talking about the Audi.  S4s aren't cheap.  She thought about leasing.  But, anyone who knows me on these boards, knows I don't like leasing.  So, I talked her out of it.Without some hefty money up front, it wasn't going to be doable for her.  We figured the payment she would be comfortable with.  We figured what it would take.  That's how we launched the plan we made.It took some car finagling on my part.  And, my name is on the note, since I'm the one who put the downpayment up.  She still has to sell an 8 year old Subaru and give me the proceeds.  And, if anything were to happen between she and I (we've been together for many years, so no need to go there....just covering all bases), the car reverts to me since I put most of the upfront money on it.  But, she's making payments.As mentioned, the closest Audi dealer wanted MSRP on the only S4 they had in stock.  They would not honor the Supplier Discount certificate.  That dealer also offered the lowest trade value.  Not doing business there (KYFDX....this is the dealership in Montgomery).  The other dealership, further away, honored the supplier discount, but still came in $2,000 shy of my number on the trade.GF contacted my son, knowing I love Chicago in the Summer, and planned to take me there for my birthday (which was last week).  That's how the plan sprang to life to research Chicago dealers for the S4.She found a dealer who had the most stock and told them what we were looking to do....with the trade and the supplier certificate.   As a back-up, there were two other dealers who had at least 1 S4 in stock.  In short, she contacted all of them.  Told them what we were trying to do, with the qualifier that we were driving 5 hours, were going to have to spend the night, and had to pay for gas/meals and lodging.  If we couldn't make a deal, they would have to pay $250 for our gas and lodging.  Smart girl....that's one of the (many) reasons I love her.Only one dealership agreed to the terms in writing (which she insisted on) via an email....the one with 4 S4s in stock.  They wanted the VIN for the Accord, and an agreement from us that if the Honda were substantially different than what we described, the deal was off.She told me of her agreement.  We decided that if anything about the deal changed, we'd be prepared to walk away, and drive home in the Accord.  My son didn't have much choice.  He had to agree to whatever we agreed to if things didn't work out.You already know how this turned out since I've posted pics of the car.  But, there's a little more to the story.To be continued......"

It's a not a direct line to get to where we ended up.So, we left on Friday after work....GF, son and me, on our way to Chicago.  Grabbed dinner once we arrived (Weber Grill.....highly recommended).  Early Saturday, GF heads for the Miracle Mile.  My son and I head to the Audi dealership.We get there as soon as they open, 9:00 a.m.  Two S4s are sitting in front, one black, and one white, all cleaned up.  The GF didn't care which one, but liked the black one, and the white one, based on pics the sales person sent her.Salesperson knew from our OH tags who we were, and immediately approached, offered coffee and doughnuts.  ""Yes"" to the coffee.  ""No"" to the doughnuts (son helped himself though).  I immediately liked the black over the white one.  Salesman gets the key, gives it to us for a test drive, as well as us giving the Accord keys to him for inspection.We take a 30 minute test drive.  Pull back to the dealership.  Salesman asks us to meet the General Manager.  We shake hands.  He's a nice guy.  Explains that he hates giving trade quotes without seeing the trade.  He points out a couple of small parking dings and paint chips on the Honda.Knowing where this is going, I ask....""so, you think the $9,500 offer you made is one you can't support?"".  A little hesitation, but in essence, that's what he was saying.He wanted to counter.  I really didn't care and got up.  Asked him if he was going to keep his agreement to at least cover our gas and lodging.  He seemed surprised at the suddeness that this deal came to such an abrupt halt.He said....""I don't want this to be adversarial.  Didn't you come to buy a car?""""I did........drove 5 hours to buy one, as a matter of fact.  Not willing to waste any more time"".The GM asked the sales person to get us some sodas.""Can I see your Supplier Certificate?""""Sure, but I'm stuck on the $9,500 for the trade"".He gave a cursory glance at the Supplier Certificate.""We want you as a customer, no matter how far away you live.  We're not going to dicker with you over a few hundred dollars.  We appreciate you coming all this way to do business with us.  Congratulations on your new car.""30 minutes later, finished with F&I, I was in the delivery area with the sales person going over the features.

My wife loves European cars much more than any others...I prefer them, but I could get used to a Cadillac or a Mustang.The Audi salesman said something that my wife was very impressed with.  He said BMW and Mercedes have their biggest markets in the U.S. so their cars are being made to appeal to that market the most.  Audi's biggest market is Europe and then China.   He said Audi for him, is holding onto it's European roots.I really think what he said is true.  When we tested the new 335 it is getting more American in ride quality and in the jazzy interior layout.  The Audi has more of a basic Euro driving feel, and the interior is tastefully less jazzed up.In our case, we like the Audi better, and it was $11000 less than a 328, and $15000 less than a 335 (if you consider $4000 more for the trade in)which we would have to have bought because her current car is a 335 and it would be difficult to go for the smaller engine after having a 335."

Sales numbers are sales numbers and aren't exaggerated unless you have some inside information that the sales numbers are wrong.  Remember last year you were dealing with a fairly unpopular(by the general public) RDX and sales could also have been curtailed by the sunami for a short time as the 2012 model, I believe, were all built in Japan.When you go from almost dead last in a category to almost 1st whatever term you care to use for the increase is correct.

3803,markcincinnati,"June 8, 2012 1:23PM","Boy did you hit the nail on the head. Acura used to offer only SH-AWD (on the AWD cars) -- and as far as I know Acura's torque vectoring rear diff was on the market before my German fave, Audi, and their sport differential (which provides the same kind of advantage in handling as does SH-AWD, albeit in a RWD biased AWD auto.)Acura used to lead, or at least it appeared that they used to attempt to lead.What have they done, what have they done? Well, look on the lots of one of their dealers -- it is really difficult to find an SH-AWD vehicle (other than the MDX). They seem to not get that FWD doesn't cut it in the Premium class. They could've simply looked at Audi (in the US).  I would assume most US customers don't even know that many of Audi's cars are sold as FWD models (elsewhere).  In the US, however, virtually all Audis are AWD and they have made their name as pioneers of AWD.  Now 40% of BMW sedans sold (in the US) are X-drive models; and even the mighty 7 series can be had with four driven wheels. Much the same can be said about Mercedes -- RWD heritage, AWD sales aplenty here in the US.Acura is cross shopped with Toyota?  Of course, because the base products Acura offers are contented more like Toyota or Honda rather than Audi or BMW and with the Germans widespread use of 7 and 8 speed transmissions and Honda, er Acura continuing to bring out NEW cars (e.g., the ILX) with a 5 speed shifter is a dead giveaway.The ILX should have been SH-AWD (only!) and come with -- at bare minimum -- the very fine 6-speed as is found in the TL.The line should adopt the ""X"" suffix and it should mean ""we're all, AWD"" models.  The new RDX comes out and it goes with the cheaper FWD biased AWD and eschews SH-AWD (and the thing can be had as an FWD -- who's dumb idea was that?)The new ILX comes out, FWD only, wimpy engine and when auto equipped has the long since forgotten (by the Germans and other Premium Japanese brands) 5-speed (what were they thinking?)My 2012 TL Advance w/SH-AWD should be the only way this car should be sold (in SH-AWD form, that is), and there should be a bunch more options to choose from and an ""S"" version to keep things interesting.I think, too, the new RLX will be stillborn -- who will pay for an RLX when they can have an Audi A6 3.0T Prestige for about the same price?Acura is the new Genesis, they just don't know it yet. I never would have imagined that Genesis cars and Equus autos could be sold at a Hyundai dealership, but here in Cincinnati the inventory of Genesis and Equus cars seems quite deep and I see them on the road virtually every day -- even the Equus.So, Acura should fold up its separate dealership network and move back in with mom and dad -- sell Acuras as higher priced Hondas, just like Hyundai sells Genesis cars as a separate line, but from the same dealership.And the reason that Lexus can ""get away"" with using some Toyotas as donor cars, is that the finished product -- from Lexus -- shares little with Toyota in its looks and interior.My TL has waaaaaaay too much Honda in it, is my point.Audis USED to have a whole bunch of VW in them -- over time Audi became a little less VW as every model year passed.  Now, there certainly is ""something"" that reminds me of Audi in a new CC -- but there is virtually nothing in an Audi that reminds me of VW. Acuras are very nice, very smooth, apparently very high resale value cars and very much like ""Hondas who know somebody.""The Premium class will miss Acura when it finally fades away.I say all of the above not as a disatisfied Acura owner -- quite the contrary, the 2012 TL is very nice -- I'd give it an A-.  It may be, however, that Acura has given up.  It no longer wants to be the Japanese Audi.  It never did want to be the Japanese BMW.  I don't know what it wants to be anymore -- but it had better figure it out soon.For the record, I've never liked Lexus -- until this year, with their new more sporting, less sofa-like, cars (esp the GS).  I am liking, more and more all the time, Infiniti, helped by the fact that my wife now has 30K miles on her 2011 FX35, and for a CUV, this thing is as impressive at 30,000 as it was at 1 (mile); and the M's are worth comparing to A6 and 5 series if you ask me.The only company that seems to be sailing the seas rudderless is Acura.More's the pity.  :surprise:"

I have to say that this car is fast for the weight its pulling. I was totally impressed with the handling because the test route was real twisty and sales guy kept insisting to push the car to its limit. Bottom line I like the car especially in the Dynamic(aka Sport) settings, very very enjoyable and the grunt was there at the bottom and at the top of tach. Here is what I dont like-the PRICE.There is absolutely no value in buying this car over TL-SHAWD. For what you get without starting to adding in the options is just outright absurd. In my opinion, this is a nice 45K car- Premiun Plus Trim, I would put the Prestige at 53K.

But, I think you could have said that about all the Japanese marks...even Toyota with their aspirations to be the biggest car company in the world didn't turn out so well for them.  The tsunami only added fuel to the fire.Hondas and Acuras are really good cars.  However, most are used to them being great cars.  Frankly, if I were one to keep a car for 200K miles (which I'm definitely not), my first stop for shopping for one would be my local Honda or Acura store.It really is impressive what less than $40K (real world price) buys if you take a test drive of an Acura TL SH AWD."

May 2012 sales were nearly triple what they were in May 2011 at 3,301 units. That's more than the BMW X3 (2,460), Audi Q5 (2,332), Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class (2,133), Volvo XC60 (1,751) and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (706). Only Cadillac's SRX did better with 3,900 units sold in May.""I've read that both the new X3 and the Q5 are pretty popular.

3853,plekto,"May 30, 2012 10:27AM","The reason they break down if they are not revved hard is due to a design flaw in the engines.  Well, it's not a design flaw, so much as that they were designed with European oils in mind that have proper levels of additives.  As well as being run at higher speeds and rpms.When the EPA forced oil companies to drop their levels of Zinc DialkylDithiophosphate (usually just referred to as ""Zinc"") to 1200ppm, they started to show increased wear.  With the move to 800ppm, it's only a matter of time before the engine eats itself if you run it like a typical yuppie.    Why?  The engines are designed with tight internal clearances that require high pressures to force oil into and out of the parts, especially the lower output bearings.You just have to learn to be happy running it at 4-5KRPM all the time.  Yes, that means running around town in 2nd gear and making some noise.   :Phttp://www.lnengineering.com/ims.htmlThe problem with the engines in detail (ignore the hyperbole and marketing and focus on the pictures and technical parts).  Low RPMs=early death.  Since the design requires higher rpms/pressure to lubricate, but oil simply starts to fail at those higher pressures that result (6000+rpm), your only fail-safe is high zinc levels.  If the oil doesn't have it, well...  Your engine blows its bearings at 40-50K miles.Note - this affects motorcycles, rotary engines, and smaller engines like the S2000 that rev past 6K rpm routinely.  Normal SAE approved oils won't cut it.  Thankfully Valvoline and a few others make higher level conventional oils.  Most are marketed as ""high mileage"" oils.   This is a nice trick, btw - always use the high mileage oil even in a new engine - as well as good conventional oil instead of synthetic if the engine does any sort of higher RPMs."

Usually if I'm lucky there isn't traffic and I can take it at a higher speed.Today I got spanked by a Porsche Cayman.  My IS 350 is sporty...but not a sports car.  I was behind and he just cruised through the curve flat and fast.By comparison (at that speed) I felt like I was going to tip overHe (assuming it was a he...self preservation of ego) was gone before I could regain my composure.Sad thing...last year a prev-gen M3 sedan showed me it's tail lights through the same yield  :surprise:"

I didn't know anything about oil back then and simply used regular Mobil 1.I'm guessing most ELLPS owners here don't plan on keeping their cars more than 4 or 5 years, so it's the CPO and used buyers that should be wary."
3856,ivan_99,"June 1, 2012 10:26AM","Ivan_99 - would you buy another IS350?I wouldn't buy the one currently being offered because it is virtually the same as mine; a 2006.  Mine was a CPO (which is now expired).  It's in surprisingly good condition but its about time to replace it.  Not certain what the new one will be like; I haven't been impressed with any of the new Lexus styling whatsoever.Down here in central TX I see many...many IS's; I obviously didn't get it for its exclusivityI had a brief stint with a Q45 before this so it was much more sporty in comparison.There were just a few things about the IS that kept bothering me.  Normal shifting was very lethargic (think Corolla stuck in sand) and sport-mode was very un-Lexus like harsh and abrupt.  Handling, such as a large sweeping yield I mentioned above, made it lean and plow to the outside.  Short quick transitions feel fine and responsive.If I had to give my IS a grade it would be an 'ok'...a 75%I may not go for another ELLPS.I'm torn in what I want.  Part of me wants to go 'all out sport' and get a used 911, but currently I do not get many opportunities to explore any driving excitement.  I use my car to commute...and that is it.  I sit in traffic for the most part inching along.  I 'live' for the odd (clear) yield or on ramp, but in the evening and weekend my car just sits.  A new Ford Focus would probably be just as rewarding.I use our other vehicle (mini-van) more often because we have young kids in sports.  So when I take my boys to football I need the room for all their gear and room to sit.  Sometimes they'll leave their cleats on...in the back of the IS it doesn't work well.Plus...I've had knee problems lately so getting in and out of the IS (even sitting) is not very enjoyable.  I need something with a more upright position.  I probably need to spend time sitting in each vehicle as there are so many variation in body style, seat style, etc.I'm leaning towards an SUV...or simple commuter vehicle."

3877,dino001,"May 21, 2012 8:30AM","My preference of stick shift has nothing to do with performance, track times, 0-60.  I'm not that good of a driver to actually take advantage of the edge, even if it existed.  I don't prefer it because of the fuel economy, as modern autos are either better or almost as good (depending on who makes them).  My preference for stick shift is only about one thing - it is feel of a connection between the throttle pedal and wheels, feedback that can be provided only by a mechanincal grip (direct friction) between clutch plates.  No matter what, fluid driven by fins (in a classic hydrokinetic transmission, aka torque converter) will give you different feel.  I've never driven DSG/SMG/DCT, but I can only imagine those transmissions as being the only equivalent device to facilitate similar feel you get from manual transmission.  I could let go the pedal, it's the connection I'd miss if switched to normal slushbox.To be completely fair, the slushbox on the 328i loaner, I had for couple of weeks came, close to what I'd consider acceptable replacement.  It was really first premium segment car I had opportunity to drive for more extended time and I almost liked the transmission.  I opted for the manual simply because it was possibly last chance I still had an option(same with the six-in-line engine, BTW).I'm resigned to strong possibility of getting a slushbox for my next car - hopefully long time from now.  It's not going to be ""terrible"", or anything like that - just a little sad, that's all.  End of an era.  But since there was a stay of the execution, I used it."

ILX being based on economy car spreads the costs much better.The problem I cannot see how in the world they could make anything close to TSX experience with ILX.  The thing is based on Civic platform :sick: whereas TSX was based on Euro/JDM Accord, which were positioned similarly to US ELLPS (and sold at appropriate prices).

The current and apparent upcoming future direction is to slowly continue to slide out of the Premium class.  One $100,000+ NSX doesn't change anything.Driving my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance is very much like driving the previous generation Audi A6 (known as the C6), perhaps a 2009 or 2010 model.That may be damning with faint praise or it may be simply mild, not wild praise that Acura in 2012 can build a decent 2009 Audi A6 clone (that isn't as good looking.)In two years I move to a new car -- at this point Acura will get a look-see, but I'm thinking so will Infiniti and Audi and Cadillac.  The Acura will have to step up its game.Today, Acura reminds me, in the pecking order of the world, as the Japanese VW.  :confuse:"

Honda has some problem, the Insight is not selling, the current Accord hasn't sold in the #'s that honda was looking for, the current Civic was cheapened and it shows. Lets hope that Honda gets it right soon, or they might be in a world of hurt.Acrua should have made the ILX into something that the Integra was, a sporty entry level upsacle car...

I find it amazing, confusing and, frankly, disappointing that dealers stock ANY cars other than what can be used for test drives.On the other hand, I realize the near suicide this suggests for American car dealers.  I was literally unable to order a car, THE car, as I wanted it.  The dealer gave me a 24 hour deal -- 87% of sticker on THE ONLY one that he had that was equipped as I wanted it, just not in the color combo I wanted.I have no idea how they did the deal, 13% is huge -- yes?I took the car, off the lot, with the worst interior color imagined by a human:   black.And now I must apologize to those who think a black interior is a good thing -- despite the fact that it makes the car seem so much smaller inside, so drab and confining.Anyway, typically (especially for European cars) buying by ordering will get the best price."

Likewise it can be argued that you can be make your car perform better IF it has a stick-shift.But the reality is that most Americans have no interest in stick shifts, hence the difficulties in finding them, unless your order one.Stick shift cars are, practically, not technically speaking, DEAD. Even in Europe they are dying.An 8-speed automatic European car is pretty nice to drive -- as is a 7 speed Japanese car. Even some six speed autotrans are good these days.Ultimately, no one will offer a stick shift -- due to lack of interest from the market.No car maker -- like BMW -- will offer a car with ONLY a manual transmission (other than their top of the line which will remain automatic) due to customer acceptance.Live with it, I say.I ordered my last stick shift in 2003, knowing the direction would be more autos and few stick shifts as every day passes.Where we are today is not the worst place we could imagine -- and frankly I wish we all drove automatics -- OH wait, we're almost there already."
3897,nyccarguy,"May 17, 2012 8:00PM","Again dino001 you bring up some excellent points.  ""Like it a lot"" is an understatement.  I've proclaimed my love for my 328xi over and over.  I got an excellent selling price (over $5400 off the $44K sticker), a low money factor (although not as low as the 0.9% APR for 60 months they were offering), and a high residual (64% for 15K per year plus 10,000 miles extra) of $26,406.  I paid only a $795 bank fee, $350 for new CT plates, $72 1st months pmt, a $12.50 NY tire fee, & taxes on these fees.

I have no doubt that the Inline 6 motor and the E90 chassis each in their last year of a model run will be close to bulletproof.Yes I will know the car.  I know there are literally thousands of similar 328xis that will flood the market in late summer/early fall 2014.  Private owners always think their car is worth more than it is & dealers charge insane amounts for loaded up, low mileage, creampuffs.  My parents each had 2 modern era BMWs (Dad - '04 X5 & '07 X5, Mom - '05 530i & '08 328xi) that both held up very well for between 10 & 30K past their respective warranties.  Even my wife's former '07 X3 was only at the dealer for scheduled maintenance for the 3 years/ 45K we had it.If I wanted to buy the car out at a nice discount at the end of the lease, I would wantr to pay cash for it.

On the other hand, as you pointed out, some dealers act like ordering a car should ""net"" them extra $$$ for the effort.  There's practically no effort involved, short of checking a few boxes on a computer screen and entering your contact information.One of the BMW dealers tried this when I was trying to get my car from the port.  They acted like there was something special, difficult, and unusual about that.  And, they felt they should charge me for that privilege.  They either couldn't, or wouldn't, make the effort to get the car from the port.  Yet, my selling dealer could...and not charge me for the effort.  My selling dealer told me ""sure....we'll get it....no problem"".  They didn't even want a deposit.I was going on vacation right after I spoke to them.  They said they'd have it ready for me when I got back a week later.  They did just that.  It was waiting for me all shined up in the showroom the day I returned.I've bought new cars in configurations I didn't 100% desire in the past (usually a color I didn't care for...either in or out).  I've bought them ""on the cheap"" figuring that would placate me.  It never did.  The undesirable parts of the car became more and more of an issue, that I usually got rid of them pretty quickly (not that I need much reason to buy a new car to begin with).But, I understand those who might do that.  And, for good reason if the price is right.  I just know me.  I'll waste more money in the long run by doing that.Finally, it's totally ridiculous to think the only good sports cars (or any car for that matter) come with manual transmissions. Last post from me on that matter.  Why bother with such silliness."

And, it would have allowed me to take a little trip to Germany, at a reasonable cost, since I could have booked so far in advance.When a dealer I visited (not the one I bought from) said they'd found the car I was looking for in port waiting to be delivered (to whom, I didn't know).  They said they could divert it while at port.  I had already agreed verbally on all pricing on the deal.  They originally agreed to go and find the car for me, and do a dealer trade.Well, since they had to get it while at port, something triggered that they wanted to charge me an additional $500 to have it sent to their dealership. All dealership cars come from the port.  It doesn't cost them extra.  I asked them to explain, but got the nebulous, gobble-de-[non-permissible content removed], BS explanation.Concurrently, my local dealer, who said they couldn't find the car I was looking for, stumbled upon this same car at the port, about 3 days later than the original dealership.  I explained I had a quasi-deal in place already.  I gave them the numbers, they agreed to them (without the additional $500 fee to get it from port).Told the dealer if they could indeed get it, I was off on vacation and would get back to them after I returned.  A week later, after vacation, I'm standing at the dealership doing the final inspection.  Why my local dealer could do what the other (further away) dealership couldn't do, is beyond me.I'm not so certain this type of behavior is the sole providence of luxury dealerships.  But, it seems some, not all, do try to try all sorts of crazy ways to pad profit in their deals."

3913,dino001,"May 19, 2012 12:51PM","No there isn't - absolutely no.  BMW is actually one of the stronger supporters of its dealer networks (i.e. it is very good to be their dealer).  My German liason in BMW Welt told me they were last ones from German manufacturers to introduce factory center pickup, mostly due to concerns over their dealers.  And they really stress the origin dealer, even during delivery process (on monitors of upcoming deliveries there is name and dealer).  It comes from history - BMW was rescued by a consortium of investors and dealer during its near bancruptcy experience (I think it was 50s) - they basically put the money to prevent the takeover by Daimler Benz.Discount?  I basically got $1000 off the Euro Delivery MSRP, which is 93% of base US MSRP plus full MSRP on options.  Not a supreme deal by any means.   If I were more aggressive, I might have got extra $500, maybe tad more, but there were additional circumstances around this order, which you can read in Sales Frontlines board - I wrote it around September (in the nutshell I was driving dealer's 328i loaner for over two weeks, which adds some value).  Tampa dealers are not very ""discounty"", especially on orders.  At time of the order, 2012 was in production, there weren't even special interest/lease offers published.Here is the main difference: currently BMW runs some cash incentives, both dealer's and customer's on existing inventory.  Those incentives often have short expirations (month or so), which basically means they cannot be guaranteed on orders.  They often get extended, but there is no guarantee.  Moreover, none of them apply to Euro Delivery.This are in nutshell reasons why orders get this ""doing you a favor"" attitude.  No instant gratification, no instant money who knows what it will be then, so if you want it, you pay.  I did, but I can see why others won't.  The differential can be too compelling to ignore, especially if you don't really care if it's black or grey, or if it has sunroof or not.  I do care more than most - and knowing my taste is off-mainstream, I have to adjust pricing expectations.  I'm OK with that, as long as it is reasonable and in return I get right treatment.  My salesman was an impressive middle-aged gentlemen with manners worthy the premium brand (e.g. every morning he recorded time-stamped voice mail greeting every work day, so you'd know if he is at work that day, or not).  When you see manners like that, it is a little easier to part with the money, if you know what I mean."

They are just as fast & get better fuel economy.

3937,dino001,"May 17, 2012 11:49AM","There may be reasons not buy your car up at the end of the lease, but I'm not sure, if I would rule that out outright just yet.  If the car gives you no trouble over next three years, you like it a lot (so far you do) and what's out there isn't so great, the buyout price should not bother you.  Here is why:You should look at it from overall six (or so) year cost perspective, not just price at the buyout.  You say you got some insane deal, which suggests you got both a good purchase price at the lease beginning, low money factor, and high residual.  So you would be giving back some of that inflated residual - in a sense you'd defer the initial purchase (which was at low price, I remind you and finance charges were not very high up to this point).So say, you leased for three years and you have to buy reminder of 50-55% of MSRP (is that the residual?). Granted, it's a lot vs. real value, which may be more in 45%- area - but is it really?  If you define your residual vs. trade-in value, it may be even less, but you have the advantage - you know the car.  Moreover, you'd never be able to buy same car on the market for that much, dealers would mark them up and other owners would also want more than the dealers are offering.  Moreover, you haven't paid much up to this point and you had a good initial discount.  To get the total nominal cost (does not include other aspects of the ownership), add all the lease payments and initial downpayments, taxes and such, buyout purchase price and say 3.5%-4% loan for 36 months (can you do 24 months? - would be better...).  If the total is still within reason vs. original car price and you like the car (and it has no problems so far), AND there is still nothing else around you'd equally like, why not do it?  The alternative is you some hum-drum commuter on a lease that you'll dread every day you sit in it and every day you'll be thinking ""why, oh why I didn't take the bimmer""?"

I decided to stick with the somewhat crappy OEM tires that came with the car, since they are all-season UHP's and I wanted to go through winter (very light even for Cincinnati) with the OEM's kind of to allow me to ""testify"" about the OEM selection.I added 4 splash guards and the backup sensors -- otherwise the thing is bone stock.I bring my own oil -- Mobil 1 -- for the changes, and all service has been performed by the dealer, Lindsay Acura, Columbus, OH.This is one boring car from a service perspective.  It did, however, seem peppier after the second oil and ""fluid"" change -- in that respect it reminded me somewhat of my experience with Audi's -- they feel more powerful at 5,000 and again at 10,000 miles.I am not used to paying for service (Audi and BMW spoiled me in that regard) -- so $230 oil changes including tire rotations are painful.

The Audi seemed to be a dirt magnet -- and I wash my cars twice weekly (including vacuuming the interiors), so it is not due to some change in my auto-hygene regimen that I tell you the Acura at 15,000 miles feels totally new, looks new, drives new, etc etc.  The only difference is it gets somewhat better mileage now and it has a bit more pep in its step.Yet the TL remains a compromise car -- it is ""in the ballpark"" with the Germans I have been used to (and by in the ballpark, I mean broadly: features, content, power, price, etc.) but it is about 9/10ths.  Now considering it's VALUE quotient, perhaps it is more than 9/10ths; but, when I push it hard through a curvy back road it makes me think, ""this is soooo close, but just not quite there.""  Of course my lease payments are $100 per month less than the outgoing 2009 A4 2.0T quattro sport and the Acura still feels the same as it did (as noted above) the day I got it.  The Audi, on the other hand, at 15,000 miles had already gone through a set of tires (and very expensive ones at that) and just seemed a bit more worn.I have come to a conclusion, perhaps incorrectly so, that like the hyper expensive tires that came with the A4 and pooped out young (they turned to powder in an effort to make the car feel as if it were on rails), perhaps the German cars perform better for a shorter period of time. The Japanese -- perhaps -- don't perform as well from the get go, but they ""take a lickin' and keep on tickin'"" with minimal fuss and care.The sales manager of the Acura store came from an Audi store and he remarked that the Germans make the best performing cars, period, but that they require the owner to take much more of an active role in maintaining that ultra high performance standard.I have a Sheltie -- very low strung, very low maintenance (groomed about every 8 weeks and that's it) -- perhaps the Sheltie analogous to a Japanese ELLPS or LPS car.  Now, then, there are some other breeds which seem to be high maintenance, but win a lot more ""best in show"" awards -- perhaps the German cars are like a high strung high maintenance dog breed.Beats me -- the Acura certainly has been superior at one thing, though: not aging.  :surprise:"

3950,markcincinnati,"May 10, 2012 9:14AM","I couldn't even begin to answer your question. Historically, Volvo's live very long lives -- and are expensive to maintain and repair like their German cousin's.Today, I would EXPECT, any car (virtually any) to make it to 150,000 miles with normal maintenance and a few repairs.Now then, the issue is what is the definition of normal maintenance?My wife's last BMW (a 2008) could only have an oil change (that was free) when the car said it needed it -- once this was at 19,000 miles. Since the car was leased, we changed the oil and did the other things when the book called for it.  To me BMW's service recommendations aren't ""normal,"" since the miles between service intervals seems impossibly long.Audis want oil changes every 10K miles -- and there is no computer inside that is determining when the maintenance should really be performed.  I would think that would make a used, late model, Audi perhaps less prone to the wear that a BMW might have with its very very long service intervals.I repeat, I have no clue how soon it will be -- in miles -- before you will notice your Volvo isn't ""new"" anymore.I turned in my 2009 A4 2.0 with just under 55,000 miles on it -- it needed new tires (what would have been its third set) and the sport suspension seemed to be a bit ""worn"" feeling.  Also it used a quart of oil every 2,000 miles, which seemed excessive, although the dealer told me there was a TSB on it that essentially cured that issue.Of our 29 German cars, only my 60,000 miles young 2005 A6 3.2 still felt ""young-ish"" after 30,000 miles.The difference in the German cars is they drive like no other -- so what you get are cars that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse.""One more time, for the same money, I'd still take the German car even though I believe it will be breathtakingly expensive to keep young.:surprise:"

Japanese are asking different question, basically at what point it is good enough and not affecting other paralled objectives.  That may be defined as lacking soul, but I don't think that is fair.

3958,markcincinnati,"May 11, 2012 10:02AM","There are plenty of resources -- both subjective and objective -- that discuss the German cars personalities or that decry the Japanese for making appliances.All the ""did too"" ""did not"" that we may throw out here can also be additional data points -- there are so many of us we're not just relying on anecdotes, that is.Virtually all cars have improved in reliability and durability -- but for whatever reason the Japanese cars (regardless of where they really come from) certainly seem to win the durability sweepstakes while the German cars typically win the fun to drive contest but pretty regularly are written about as being less durable.My rattle free TL or my wife's rattle prone BMW certainly can't be assumed to represent all Acuras or BMWs and certainly shouldn't be assumed to represent ANYTHING other than themselves.The surveys that are availble, however, regularly and frequently conclude that a Japanese car family (fill in the blank) will often far outlive a ""similar"" German car family (also fill in the blank) insofar as durability is concerned.  And of course there is the matter of the expense of keeping any car beyond a certain point.One of the folks I work with has a 13 year old Lexus and a 10 year old BMW -- both with well over 100K miles on the odometer. Both cars are paid for -- yet the BMW is often being driven in so that it could get the latest $1,100 repair or replacement part -- NEVER has the Lexus required such an outlay, according to my buddy.On the other hand, another co-worker's BMW required new rotors and pads at 50,100 miles and his service cost almost the day out of warranty was over $1,800.Now I wouldn't say the BMW was non durable due to the service costs the day the warranty died -- it just seems odd that would happen so young.  The Japanese cars, have earned a reputation for long long lives -- we, here, are not the cause of such reputations, but perhaps there is something to it.The European cars -- Germans in particular -- do not enjoy such reputations, no matter what we argue here.  :surprise:"

Now if it is decked out with much of the stuff that is optional on the 328 like leather, etc, etc, etc.  It may already be a value proposition.  The base starts at about $33000 and only has the 200 hp.  This is probably going to be for people that like a small Cadillac but don't need all the go-go.  Again, how decked out ""base"" cars will be is the question that hasn't been answered by GM yet.  If a 270hp 2.0 ATS has enough standard it may still undercut BMW(apples to apples options) so heavy discounting may not be necessary.No real test drives have been done either so if those turn out to be very good and the pricing is right it may be very competitive.

My company has a couple of cars for those of us visiting to use.  I think they lease them as they change every 3-4 years.  They put me in a diesel Jaguar.  Not a bad car, at all.

I got a job selling Lexus and then manager of an Infiniti Store.  I have found that Mercedes manufactures, designs and engineers the most trouble-free sedans in both their C and E class lines.  I've owned 7 E Class Sedans and have never, ever had any of them in to the service department for repairs, issues, or anything, except oil changes.I doubt it is just ""luck"".  Not after experiencing BMW 5 series issues with two identical cars with identical electrical issues, both manufactures in Germany and shipped here in the same year, 2008.I found that Infiniti is most closely alligned with BMW in terms of ride and handling and power along with Audi.  Lexus seems to be in a class by itself, as is Mercedes.  I do not compare Mercedes to BMW, Audi or Infiniti due to the ride and handling differences.Finally, Mercedes E Class Sedans and Coupes are equipped with a 302 horsepower powerplant and fuel economy over 30 mpg hwy.In summary, Audi, BMW, Lexus, Mercedes and Infiniti manufacture outstanding vehicles.  Each one is just a little different from the other - enough so that they attract a large segment of the driving public.  The only think BMW has over the other brands in this category is free total maintenance which saves the driver about 300-600 dollars a year, depending upon when a car is due for brakes, etc.  Otherwise, I rate the entire segment mentioned above as outstanding value for the dollar."
3996,abacomike,"April 21, 2012 9:41AM","I spoke with Mercedes, and they told me that they are trying their best to increase mpg's across the line as they will not meet federal mandates in 2 years if they don't start now.They are phasing out the C300 (4 matic is sold down here only, as you know, so it is almost impossible to get a C300 down here in FL) and increasing the lines mpg's with the C250 and the higher horsepower, higher fuel efficient C350.Also, very shortly they will be expanding their ""engine shut down at stops for longer than 30- secs"" which they claim will increase mpg's by 20% throughout their line.  When you stop for more than a few seconds at a light, the engine shuts down automatically.  It starts up immediately when the accelerator is depressed.

4001,nyccarguy,"May 1, 2012 12:10PM","Flightnurse made a comment to me a few weeks back about me getting to see what my 328xi's AWD system can do in the rain.  Now I've always really questioned AWD's effectiveness in the rain, thinking of it as more of a useful tool for snow traction.  Unless BMW's XDrive is so transparent that I don't know how well it is working.  Kind of similar to my Prelude's ATTS.  I really didn;t know how good it was until I drove my TSX around some of the same tight corners and the front tires were fighting the stability control whereas my Prelude pulled around the corner.One of the benefits to having to be at work at 7:30 AM (6 days a week) is there aren't too many cars on the road when I leave my house at 6:30 AM.  It started pouring early this AM (my 3 year old woke up with a 102 fever and a stomach virus well before 5), so the roads were saturated with lots of nice puddles in addition to being slick.  I put my 328xi through the paces on my way to I 95.  Only a few times when I had the transmission in DS was I able to break traction only to have the stability control tuck me back into place.  So I don't know how the AWD performed.  Maybe some of you with the 335xi or sween's G35X can comment how the AWD works in the rain.I can tell you that driving down I 95 in the torrential rain, my 328xi was sure footed and rock solid.  I looked down at my speedo and saw I was going 80 without breaking a sweat.In the dry, gorgeous, spring weather we've been having, I've been able to hit the magical triple digit mark during passing maneuvers.  Unless you are a torque junkie (not that there's anything wrong with that), my 230 hp is just perfect for public road consumption.5 1/2 weeks and over 2300 miles.  As you can tell, I'm one happy BMW driver!"

Also if you look at the Toyota Pruis line of cars, the Prius V fully loaded is 30K, and the EPA rated the V lower then what the real world people are getting with the TDI.It will be interesting to see what VW does with the passt, right now you can lease a Passt S for $205/m for 36/months with ZERO down...

I think that guy Mark has it all confused.He's talking about maintenance costs (or lack thereof because of prepaid plans; whether built-in or added).   Maintenance costs have nothing to do with reliability or durability.Reliability issues come from Chrysler using corroded metals and wires for starter cables, batteries, and terminals.    Other issues come from faulty O2 sensors, fuel pumps, O-rings, head gaskets, automatic transmissions that can't go 70K without being rebuilt, parking brake problems, rattles, short-lived belts, AC compressors that can't last 40K.Reliability issues are things that I have to pay for when I bought a Dodge but never had to pay for when I bought a Honda (and not because of a prepaid built-in maintenance plan aka BMW)!.   I had to get brake pads and rotors for both, so that doesn't count.  There's just a million things and parts that break down on a domestic product that never seem to be an issue in my Japanese and German experiences."

On the other hand, I have found that German vehicles (ergonomics) less ""flamboyant"", more ""earthy"", more functional and easier to master!This opinion is based upon yearly new car purchases.  Even when comparing German to German vehicles, BMW is a sporty luxury vehicle as is Audi while I've found Mercedes to be a luxury sport sedan.  I currently own a 2012 E350 sport sedan and find it more ergonomically satisfying than the other German entrants.But Lexus is a bit more ""relaxed"" while Infiniti is a bit ""stiffer"" ergonomically!  I would compare Infiniti more closely with BMW and Audi - than with Mercedes or Lesus.  In fact, Lexus is in a class by itself as is Mercedes - each quite different ergonomically from Audi, BMW and Infiniti.I truly enjoy the Mercedes interior and refinements and find its ergonomics to be somewhat of a cross between the subtler Lexus and the stiffer BMW-Audi-Infiniti.Let's face it - all entrants here have successfully enjoyed gains in US market-share.

I've had an Infiniti for almost 10 years(95k miles) and probably haven't spent more than a $1500 in routine maint the whole time.  Oil changes are about $30-$40 and the dealer always rotated the tires for free during the original warranty period.  Now Costco does it for free as part of their tire deal.   That's about $150 a year and there were several years where it was just two oil changes and that was it.   Total repairs to this vehicle are also under $500 although I do need a new power antenna.

The german lease argument very true but what if your looking at a used BMW - shouldn't you look at an unbiased mag like CR (who has 10!yrs of data) to make an informed decision - or just ask a buddy who has had ONE reliable/durable audi that he owned from new ?

The SH AWD models require a little more, but not much more.Price for maintenance on a TL shouldn't vary much from a Honda either.BMW service.....on the one previous to my current one, I swapped out the run flats as they were horrid.  The new run flats on my current 335i are much better.

Never had any problems with the fuel system needing to be cleaned......EVER!I throw in a bottle of Techron into the gas tank every 10,000 miles just to be on the safe side."
4049,nyccarguy,"April 14, 2012 7:37AM","We all seem to agree (I think) that BMW's free maintenance is (1) built in to the price of the car and (2) has extended intervals since BMW started including it.  Wherever you sit on this, there's no doubt in my mind that it adds value.  I was looking through my own 328xi's vehicle computer and found that my car will require the following scheduled maintenance:15,000 miles - oil change (within year 1)25,000 miles - front brake pads (within year 2)29,000 miles - Inspection I - major service (within year 2)30,000 miles - rear brake pads (within year 2)Now let's use that schedule and see what else I can muster up.45,000 miles - oil changeThat's it for the maintenance that is included in the cost of my BMW.  2 oil changes (at the dealership) + 1 major service + front pads + rear pads add up to something.Now not everyone does the 20K miles per year that I do, so they don't get the full value of the included maintenance.Here's where things get interesting.  When my lease is up, my car is going to have 50,000 miles.  I'm going to have a few choices & decisions to make.Option 1 is obviously just to turn my car in and walk away.Option 2 is to buy my car (from the dealer, not BMWFS) after the lease is up & hopefully be able to negotiate a price that's significantly cheaper than the lease end buy out of a little more than $26K.  Say I can buy it for $21K it would be a nice used car.  If I buy the car, I wouldn't go for the CPO warranty (on my previous X3 they wanted $3K to certify it), but I most certainly would go for the extended maintenance pkg that covers the maintenance up to 100K miles.  IMO, even at the $2K MSRP (think I could maybe get it cheaper), it will get me:50,000 miles - Front Brake pads (& maybe rotors)60,000 miles - Inspection II (major service incl oil, filter, brake fluid, trans fluid, coolant)75,000 miles - Oil Change90,000 miles - Inspection I (semi-major service)I'd also be financing the buyout.Option #3 is to lease another car.  There most likely won't be these crazy incentives on the F30 328xi that were on my car, so I'm sure a lease with the same parameters (20K miles per year) is going to be upwards of $650 - $675/ month which is too rich for my blood.Option #4 would be to buy a similar car to mine that has literally 1/2 the miles.  My only problem with that is dealers seem to have high asking prices on loaded up, off lease, CPO cream puffs.I'll see what happens.  For now I Love this freakin' car!"

4051,dino001,"April 14, 2012 9:02AM","Glad somebody else agrees with me on that.  You probably have all-seasons on yours (xi gets summer tires only with M-pack, IIRC), which should be a little more gentle anyway.  One drawback on the sports/M-packs are staggered size tires, which basically means the can't be rotated (the tires are also unidirectional).  This basically creates a potential for more alignment needs than in normal car.  However, tires can also be replaced only 2 at the time, if one is worn more than the rest due to some misalignment issues.Anyway, I think that alignment stuff not being part of the ALL, ALL, AND ALL (BUT TIRES) FREE is kind of baloney on part of BMW.  I understand that car may never need alignment, and it is a function of road hazard, but knowing general condition of roads and overall risk, it is quite common to check it once in a while.  Why can't it be a part of Inspection I, beats me.  If you advertise that there is nothing, but gas and tires, than it should be just that."

I have the 3 year plan for my van, and that was only about $125 with a coupon, and I can have it redone every 6 months for 3 years, so average it out and I am paying about $20 per alignment (and just have it done when the van is in for the free rotation and balance that came with the tires)."

To me leasing is only worth it if the manufacturer subsidizes it with a ridiculously high residual (like my wife's former '07 X3 @ 65% after 3 years/45K or my current 328xi @ 64% after 30 months/50K) or an insanely low money factor.  Don't forget I was also able to take advantage of a $2500 rebate which allowed me to buy the car way under invoice.If I were to finance, it would cost me $120 per month more ($3600) + with the amount of driving I do, I'm guaranteed a residual value of 64%.  2 1/2 or 3 years down the road if I were to trade the car in, no way the dealer is going to give me $26K for the car, especially when there are similar cars out there (thousands) with 1/3 to 1/2 the amount of miles.  No way I'm going to justify a mid to high 6 hundred something lease payment.  It's simply too much.Don't forget, this car payment isn't my only one.  I'm on the hook for the Pilot until May 2016."

I would suspect that if both experience 5 minor problems that Mr E class would note every single one.  There is an expectation that once you spend a certain amount that everything should be working correctly (I also subscribe to this theory).  The Rio guy didn't see the, fictional, power window switch not working as a problem...because hey...it didn't leave me stranded...and they fixed it under warranty.I would also suspect that once you start adding in ""free"" maintenance it skews the results.Then I have my couch theory that relates to demographics.  Give the same couch to college dudes and grandma.  After 3 years which couch is more ""reliable"".  What if grandma's really liked a particular couch (wonder why Buick is so high on JD Powers...).  Or why, for some reason,  the Lexus GS and IS had worse than their ""normal"" reliability rating; answer: because they sell those to people like me (drive it like you stole it).Speaking of JD Powers.  A while ago I compared the long term reliability from two separate periods.  Conclusion: A new Audi is as reliable as a Toyota from 5 years ago...the new Toyota is even more reliable...but if 5 years ago you were ""happy"" with the number of problems per 100 vehicles...you could justify a new Audi"

There were several times, when I read results of their surveys vs. what I knew about the car, it became evident to me there is a lot pretending there.  Case in point - Subaru Legacy.  Since 2005, it had three distinct levels of trim with totally different engine performance.  While standard four cylinder is so-so, the GT trim turbo is a beast, one of the fastest in the group.  Yet, JP Powers would allow you to choose specifically ""GT"" trim and would still assign lower than average acceleration to it.  I suspect, the surveys were not properly sorted, there was probably not enough data for separate GT trim, but JP Powers would not admit that - they'd rather give you garbage data based on averaged low-end trim line and pretend it also pertained to the higher one.  Once I discovered that, it became clear to me these guys know much less than they are pretending to do.Not to mention their choices for categories, like ""harsh ride"" somehow becomes part of a ""quality"" in their ""initial"" or ""long term"" quality studies.  Pure ignorance taken to extreme."

I can't understand the argument that because a car costs 1/2 as much it should be half as reliable (or expectations as such should be lower).If I pay 1/2 as much I'd expect my HP and Torque, comfort, luxury to be halved, but not the reliability.

It was related to their goal of being No. 1 in sales, catching a moderate case of GMnitis, absorbing too many new suppliers too quickly and attempting too aggressive pricing cuts to meet the points (and sales quotas).  The acceleration thing was just the apex of the process.  Regardless whether the issue was real or imaginary (pedal was real and they kicking and screaming admitted it, electronics may have been imaginary) , CR simply noticed what people did - their new spanking Camries and Lexuses (Lexi?) were NOT as reliable as the previous ones.  They had no choice, but take them off that ""automatic recommendation"" list.  BTW automatic recommendation really meant that if a new model tested well enough to get positive review, they would not wait for the reliability data to recommend it, as history of previous models had a consistent track record of good reliability.  Toyota simply lost that streak.  There are plenty of models that have good reliability, but are not recommended due to lower score in tests and vice versa - good score, but reliability below average, or ""New/no data"".It is all consistent.  One can dispute their ratings (they tend to focus things that enthusiasts simply don't care about and other items that are very important to the enthusiasts get low weight in their score), also their reliability survey method can sometimes be disputed, as well.  I just don't exactly believe in conspiracy that the results are predetermined.  BMW 3-series is usually ""in or out"", depending on the year, point in the cycle.  They usually get top ratings in their category (so even CR likes them as ELLPS), but the recommendation is occasionally withheld, when the survey data shows consistent issues with significant repairs, regardless whether paid by the owner, or in warranty.BTW, Honda is going through similar crisis today as Toyota did in late '00.  It is not related to reliability, but to overall design/quality feel.  The new civic is such a flop (not in real terms, vs. expectations and competition progress) that Honda decided to accelerate the refreshing cycle."

I'm so ready to drop the hammer & see what it's made of;)I'll take some interior shots tomorrow.The difference between the BMW & others in the class is the fact that I've wanted a BMW of my own for a long time now.  Growing up in the 1980's, I never thought much of the E30's 3 box styling.  It wasn't until a close friend graduated college & bought himself a fully loaded E36 325is w/ stick shift & sport package.  It stickered for about the same as an E36 M3 at the time.  One night we were at a club in Buffalo.  At about 2AM, he was trying to hook up with some 6' blonde girl (my friend is 5'6"").  I told Chris I needed to get home to drive back to school (Ithaca) the next day.  He tossed me his car keys & said:  ""see you for breakfast.""I remember sliding into the sport seat of that E36 and it just fit me perfectly.  I spent the next 2 1/2 hours tearing around the streets of Buffalo.  I even perfectly rotated the car around corners & steered it's tail end with the throttle a few times.At breakfast the next AM.  ""Bradd, you know I don't care, but what were you doing with my car last night?""I tell him how much I LOVE his car & how difficult it will be to hop into my car (1992 Beretta GT) & drive back to Ithaca.  ""Why?""Chris tells me his sky pager kept going off (they say blowin up now) with messages like:  ""Chris, slow down!"". ""Chris, I think someone stole your car.""From that night in Buffalo until last week, I've wanted a BMW of my own.  I finally got it!  And I love it!"
4119,graphicguy,"March 30, 2012 5:23AM","nyc....you did good on your deal.  No worries there.I'm not one of those people who ""baby"" cars during break-in.  Now, I don't go tearing through the gears, redlining each one, every time I'm behind the wheel.  Nor, do I test the limits of ABS when I first get a car.But, I also don't make any undo effort to keep below a certain speed/RPM.  That philosophy has served me well.Wait until you get about 5K miles on it.  It seems to really open up then.  And MPG improves around that mark, too.Have fun!fedlawman....the 335i still uses the I-6, only it has the dual scroll turbo.  It also has all the other current engine tricks with VANOS (variable valve timing) and direct injection.  I took mine a step further and had the dealer add the power kit package that boosts HP by 20 and torque by 30+.  This is sanctioned by BMW, is warranted the same as the regular BMW warranty, and is mainly an update to the engine management system.I think both 3.0 I-6s (boosted and non-boosted) are way underrated for HP and torque, as both feel a lot stronger than BWM's numbers suggest."
4120,flightnurse,"March 30, 2012 6:31AM","I agree I don't baby mine nor do I red line it either, so far I'm averaging 21 in mine I only have 3700 miles on it too.I was under the impression that the 335i engine had the double VANOS (intake and exhaust.) Also if you swap out the intercooler for an aftermarket unit you will increase HP about 15%, this wont void the warranty either.German HP rating, I don't think it is just BMW, but all German brands. For the amount of HP that the german print I have always though they were off their mark. The 7 series with the Twin Turbo 6 is rated at 315hp and 330lbs, moves this 4600lb car fro 0-60 in 5.8 sec. This is a couple of ticks slower then a 3 series 4 cy turbo. Very impressive, when we drove one, I could have sworn it had more HP then what BMW rated it at.FN"

Very unofficial, and done with a passenger holding a digi watch, but I put up a 0-60 in the low 5s in my 335i.  That was before the Power Package install.

We took out every and any thing that had weight to it.  We got to the point where the body looked like aluminum foil on the inside.We spent most of our effort with the 302, performance heads, exhaust, etc.  We trailered it to the track and trailered it home.  I wish I still had the money I put into that heap.  But, it was fast.  And, we had an awfully good time messing with it over the years.It sat in my buddy's back yard for a few years.  Finally, his wife told him he either had to use it, or lose it.  We sold the drivetrain complete.  But, we parted out the rest of what was left of it.  I think there are actually two boxes of parts left of it still sitting in his garage.Went to that same track 2-3 years ago just to watch.  In addition to Cameros, Firebirds and Mustangs, we saw a lot of WRXs, EVOs, a few of those recent half hearted GM attempts to revive the dead again Pontiac GTOs.The WRXs and EVOs should stick to motor cross.  We saw more than one of each blow up on the track.  The Fast and Furious crowd think that putting a NOS system in them is all it takes.  You could tell when they injected them....they'd get a 50 yard burst, a big ""POW"" and then lots of smoke and limping away."
4131,stickguy,"April 2, 2012 7:59AM","I still get a laugh out of the people that try to make a NA 328 out to be some kind of slug that can barely get out of it's own way. Unless you are out on a track (and I mean a real track, not auto-x) it is still (even an AWD slushbox) scary fast, when you are talking about driving in the real world.Going back a few years, my (sons) 2000 Acura TL is also a ticket magnet.  that car just loves to cruise fast.  75 seems to be it's natural loafing sweet spot, and if you don't pay a lot of attention it will creep right up to 90 without noticing it.Was like that since new according to my sister (the original owner) and will still do it now with 162K on the clock.  Good thing my son is religious about using CC coming down from the north country (there is a whole lotta nothing on I81 and the NE extension of the PA turnpike, and you could easily cruise at 100)"

Let's remember the car starts at 37k without options - again nice car but it's not end all be all- certainly not in automatic form and certainly not for the inflated msrp.  I would equate this car to Kentucky basketball Always a good team, wins the championship a lot  - but doesn't play by the rules- entry level sedan should not cost this much new."

We bought a 2011 Pilot. Given the fact that the TSX was less than 2 years old at the time I didn't want to take a steep depreciation hit, so I kept it, made the Pilot my wife's daily driver, & put my beloved Prelude into semi retirement.So on Thursday night, I traded in my TSX for a 2011 BMW 328xi.So far I'm completely blown out of the water about how well this car drives.  I hate to sound like I've been reading too much Car & Driver, but the steering is perfectly weighted (nice & heavy, how it should be) & telepathic.I love the chassis' balance.  Driving a car with RWD just feels very natural.  The inline 6 is just so amazingly smooth.  The brakes are strong.  Suspension tuning is wonderful.  Firm & solid, but nowhere near uncomfortable.My Acura was a nice car.  Excellent fit & finish.  The 2.4L 4 banger loves to rev.  The transmission is crisp and doesn't struggle keeping the engine in its sweet spot.  The suspension is tuned to allow road feel.  It's good, until I drove the 3er.The electric power steering is artificial and lifeless.  The brakes are weak."

What do you need to do in the first 30k? I think the whole lux sheak feel of the lux dealer should be a thing of the past- great they have a lattes but they also high maintence bills-
4182,plekto,"March 12, 2012 8:11PM","You might consider the Mercedes C with the sport package.  It's actually a much better car than the Volvo.  But the car that you really need to try before you buy a G37 is a Cadillac CTS.  It's flat-out a better car than the G37 as it does nearly the same things when driven hard, but has a nicer interior and is better in every day traffic as well.  Also, the rebates are quite good.  At the end of the model year, expect to be able to get the AWD model for close to 37-38K.GM makes exactly two great cars.  The Corvette is one, and this is the other."
4183,flightnurse,"March 13, 2012 7:24AM","Graphicguy I'm lucky that my work have me traveling a lot, and I rent many cars, I have driven the CTS 92011 MY) and I liked it, The fit n finish wasn't as good as say Audi or BMW but much better then most GM cars. I wish they would drop the ""regular"" 3.6 and just have the 3.6DI as the base engine though and 8 spd tranny then I think it would have the edge it would need to steal sales from others."
4184,mkahn21,"March 13, 2012 7:35AM","In my initial evaluations (online and at the Philly car show in February), I looked at both the CTS and the C class.The CTS just felt and looked big, relative to the others. There's a fan base out there for this car and the reviews are stellar, but I just didn't feel ""right"" inside the vehicle. Plus it's expensive when equipped comparably. (Edit - I didn't see the note above about the rebates. Interesting and maybe I'll revisit before the deal is done.)The C-class is an interesting case. It's probably a great car, performance wise. It's just that I didn't want to put out a certain, vaguely defined impression with colleagues and bosses about being a Mercedes driver. Interesting how these kinds of things play out in the decision making that have nothing to do with the actual vehicle performance itself.And what's really interesting is that I would have had no issue whatsoever putting out an impression of being a BMW driver, if I could afford it."
4185,plekto,"March 13, 2012 7:57AM","Of course, the *old* GM was an entirely different story.  Even the previous generation CTS was a joke compared to the present one.  It's the first car that GM has ever made that the engine doesn't sound like it came out of a tractor.I've been not too impressed with Volvos as of late.  They frankly remind me of fancy 90s era GM FWD sedans.  Now, that said, when I had to help my parents decide between cars, it came down to a decision between a G37, a C350 Sport, and a CTS.  The C350 was easily the most luxurious.  Not that flashy Beverly Hills crud, but more like the old wealth you see in the upper end of London.  Understated but obviously much better.Handling and driveability went to the G37.  But it also felt plastic and ""thin"".  Kind of like the same problem you get with the TSX.  It's nice and all, but it doesn't have the same feel of say, an Audi or Porsche.  You know that feeling.  Leather alone doesn't make a luxury car.    ""Leather plated"" comes to mind for many cars these days.    Now, the Infiniti M, that's a whole other story.  Check it out and then wonder why they didn't make the G feel more like a smaller M.To top it all off, the G37 looks like everyone else's jellybean.  Is it an Infiniti or a Hyundai or... Who knows until you get within about 100 ft of it.The CTS was the best combination of the two, though.  It's a usable car for daily driving and feels like it's worth the money inside and out.  Bit of sport, bit of luxury, and exactly what a luxury sport sedan should be.  Only the BMW felt similar to drive. But the BMW also has two major issues.  One is the cost of repairs, and the other is that it's not a U.S. company.   Now, this is a minor point, to be sure, but there is something to be said about driving a domestic car and not being part of the typical sheeple horde.Plus, nobody poor drives a new Cadillac.   There is till some status involved with owning one, even if it is just a little bit.  :P"
4186,graphicguy,"March 13, 2012 8:52AM","mkahn....as always, only you know what you'll be happy with.  Again, this was on an '11 CTS, but I know the dealer I visited, who's not part of a large conglomerate, with only one store, was willing to move units.  I actually met the owner.  He personally gave me the price (which was invoice, less rebates, less some of his holdback).  All-in-all, he offered me a CTS coupe, totally loaded, for about $7K off MSRP and well under invoice.This was last summer, so I don't know if such a deal could be made today.Either way, they're nice cars."

But, who knows over the long haul.I've always felt that GM makes some of the best automatic transmissions in the world however.Not a big fan of Bose.  But, the one in the CTS (surround system) was probably better than any factory stereo I've heard.

4190,tlong,"March 13, 2012 6:24PM","IMHO it's going to be tough in the $30's. There isn't much out there that handles like a Mazda 3 until you get to the $40's.

Now if you said the tsx 4 vs the g25 - well I would have to defer to someone who drOve the 25- or why the brain at Nissan why it was made. I think it should not be here in 25 form like the is250. The regal GS has its eyes on the tsx, more power manual and better looking - but that is a different fight. Why not addthe turbo sonata - its got more power leather and a nav just like the tsx?I think the tsx gets a pass here bc 10 years ago it was added and over those 10 years the group has changed but it remains.But you yourself agreed that it's the cars listed on the right that are relevant.

That has 'some' luxury elements to itHow about the Hyundai Genesis 5.0 R-Spec...seems luxurious and sporty (for under 50k).I think the exclusivity of a name (take your pick, MB, Lexus, etc) is fading now that you can option-up solid, well-build 'regular' vehicles.  IMO there are some 'lesser' vehicles such as a Focus Titanium (and soon ST) that are more rewarding and more luxurious than a TSX (no offense to TSX owners...I actually like the old and new ones).Of course the luxury dealer network also comes into play.  My Lexus dealer is far above any another other I've visited (Audi, Infiniti)I'm not certain the omission of a mini-van is a qualifier for luxury status; MB R-Class (no sliding doors...but we all know it's a mini-van).

I don't especially like GM stuff, but I do know where to find all the controls (it's called standard work).  Either way, the Charger was a fine ride, and I figured out most of its controls fairly quickly (except for the fuel door release, which took awhile).The charger and the Kia were both worlds better than most cars available 10 years ago.Given the pissing match that this board has become, mostly due to him who shall remain nameless, it's still worth pointing out that ALL these cars are good.  Everyone is railing about marginal stuff.Not a bad place to be."
4225,mkahn21,"March 12, 2012 5:32AM","I haven't researched this class since 2006, when I bought a TL. Still love that car: >95K miles and going strong.We're replacing our other car (a crossover), and I want another entry lux sport sedan. Price limit: low $40s. Must have AWD, and at least a tendency toward the aggressive/handling rather than the comfort/luxury end of the spectrum. Finally, the nav and controls must be highly intuitive.I test drove 3 cars this weekend: G37x, S60 T6, and A4 quattro. All had similar ""premium"" packages and navigation. I ruled out the new TL, my dad has one and I don't like the interface and am ""meh"" on the styling. Plus it feels too big. Heck, I think I even like my previous generation TL better.Impressions:G37x: Awesome drive, great interior. I left the lot trying to think of something I didn't like about the car. Trunk space isn't huge ... that's about it. I couldn't find a compromise anywhere. Really a standard bearer, even 4 model years into its generational life.S60 T6: I didn't expect to love this car, but I did. I thought its handling and power were up there with the Infiniti. Plus the seats are amazingly comfortable, and the exterior styling really appeals to me. The only drawback is the nav system/computer - I thought the buttons were too small and the whole interactive experience was less easy than it could be. Still, a great car and a welcome surprise.A4 quattro: Outside and in, this car is gorgeous, beautiful, luxurious, well-appointed, pick the adjective. It's just a pleasure to look at, sit in, and touch. Even the nav/multiscreen monitor was pleasant to look at. The handling is superb and it's probably the most athletic of the 3 around corners. The word ""taut"" readily comes to mind. I just wish it were quicker off the line. The A4 didn't leave me breathless the way the other 2 did.For value (which I define as how much power and goodies you get for your money), I think the G37x is a star: $2K-$3K less than the others comparably equipped, and $7K less than the BMW 335i xDrive, which I'd buy if money were no object.This class really is impressive with a lot of smart, good choices. I'll be buying my G37x shortly and will hopefully get many years of pleasure from it ...... Unless anyone suggests I check out another option I've missed?"

4235,plekto,"March 7, 2012 8:37AM","It's the fact that the new 3 series is a bit too heavy and a bit too isolated from the driving experience.  The consensus on the new transmission is that it's not nearly as good as the previous generation model, either.  Essentially the 3 series has priced and sized itself out of the market and a lot of people wish they had bought the 1 series instead.Acura has the same problem as well.  The current generation models are much larger than their predecessors and while they are nicer looking and feeling inside, they really don't drive any better.  In fact, if anything, it's a bit worse for the same sort of reasons as the BMW.  Unfortunately, Acura doesn't sell a smaller car than the TSX in the U.S.Note, this also applies to many other makers.  The CTS, for instance, is a 5 series competitor and doesn't belong here either.  The new ATS should, though.  The G37 is honestly right at the upper end of what's acceptable, especially since you really don't need the AWD version.  AWD is only a must for FWD cars in this class.  But it's still quite heavy.Now, my favorite car in this class, is the RX-8.  Yes, I know, the stupid rear doors aren't exactly styled and put on right, but it's really a sedan masquerading as a ""coupe"".    3000lbs almost exactly and it handles like a dream as you'd expect.  It might not be the fastest or the best on a test track, but it dodges in and out of traffic like a go-kart by comparison to most other cars."
4236,m6user,"March 7, 2012 8:47AM","RX-8 is a Mazda and Mazda, while nice drivers, are not remotely considered to be luxury or even ""near-luxury"".  Acura is coming with the ILX this late spring or summer.   A smaller replacement for the TSX and can be had in a  stick with a little over 200hp I believe.   Basically, it's a luxury Civic SI and from what I saw at the auto show looks very nice style wise and the interior treament makes you forget what a disaster the Civic is.  Pretty well done and will come in in the high twenties."

His daily driver is a 335xi w/ a stick.  During the test drive I asked him what his opinion of the new F10 328i was.  He really likes the 2.0L 4 cyl turbo engine & the 8 speed automatic.  He said they definitely softened up the ride (he doesn't like).  When I asked about the new electric power steering, he replied:  ""Not a fan.""I will keep you guys updated as well as all my friends on the other boards here on Town Hall."

4246,markcincinnati,"March 8, 2012 8:29AM","The wheelbase of the TL is 109"". The wheelbase of the A4 and G is longer.  The width of my A4 was close to 72"", about the width of a TL.  The length of the TL, too very close to the A4 and G.  Audis are always given crap for being porky and nose heavy.The Audi, of the three examples, would be my first choice -- if money was no object.  The Audi A4 2.0T Prestige with sport package was way more money per month than a TL (or a G.)  The G was so tiny, so narrow, I felt like I was in one of my wife's three Audi TT's -- I felt like a bug in it.  I noticed no loss of cabin space from my '09 A4 when I went to the TL.In terms of handling, the A4 when pushed hard into a corner understeers -- even with the 19"" sport package; at the same speed the torque vectoring of the TL AWD manages to tame what would have to be noticable understeer. And, despite the sweet 2.0T engine, the 3.7 in the TL is more potent.The TL is on the cutting edge of ugly, I will not argue that point.  The Audi's interior is so much better than anyone else's it's not a contest, so the TL's nice leather and fit and finish don't impress me since I was used to the Audi.  The G's interior is nice, too, but again it isn't an Audi.By what measures is the TL a boat -- it certainly seems to compete with the Audi even though the Audi does have a longer wheelbase.  Or is the Audi in the nautical class too?  :confuse:"

I would like to see the press release or a car mag that inFact states this is true- not some comment about the Altima, a car that's for sure the same body style bit 90% of its sales are 4cyl, is fwd, and uses a cvt- 3 major differences when doing a redu.

The sheetmetal bolted to it isn't shared between the vehicles, so it doesn't matter if one gets redesigned UNLESS it is moving to a new platform.HOWEVER, in this case, you are incorrect anyway, as the G is on the FM platform (RWD/AWD), while the Altima is on the D platform.Speaking of which, the FM platform is already 11 years old. I wish Nissan would either replace it altogether or keep using it just for SUVs. The damned thing results in porky cars. They need something lighter yet more rigid for the Z/G, IMHO."

My issue is that many cars that are just thrown into the discussion based upon either price or the fact that they are the bottom-tier model of the make.A ""Performance Sedan"" is another name for ""Sports Sedan"", right?  Well, let's see that it says on wikipedia:  (Note - when I typed in ""Performance Sedan, it pulled up Sports Sedan instead)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_sedanQuote:The term ""sport sedan"" also came into being, when comparing luxury import sedans (i.e. BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz), which were smaller cars popular with young buyers that focused on performance and handling, to domestic luxury marques such as Cadillac and Lincoln, for older customers and which emphasized size and comfort.""A big front wheel drive boat like the TL isn't part of this group, anymore than a Toyota Camry V6 is.  And before you go off on me about the TL being on the list on that Wikipedia page, it's referring to the previous generation A-Spec model that was sold in Canada and Japan only.  The current model is much larger and more like a fancy Camry than a sports sedan.When I heard the original poster talking about choosing between the TL and a G37, I had to do a double-take.

4275,plekto,"March 5, 2012 2:55PM","The main issue that I have with the current generation TL, is while the AWD model does fit the handling and usability model, it utterly fails because it's clearly an entire size/class too large.3948 Lbs for the AWD model without a driver or typical accessories and things (floor mats, tank of fuel, maps and stuff in the glove box, etc...) is just simply too heavy.   A typical person will be rolling down the road in one at a whopping 4200lbs.The previous generation S could manage to barely eek into this category with a ~3400lb weight. (though FWD did kind of keep it from being a true contender)And, yes, I did drive one last year.  Absolutely underwhelming in turns and the steering was so over-boosted that it felt, quite honestly, a lot like a Buick.  And not in a good way, either.

4295,flightnurse,"February 26, 2012 9:50AM","In some sense I agree with you completely on the overrated thing, however BMW is really the only game in town that allows you to tailor the car to your liking. To offer a front engine, rear wheel drive, manual car with a good sport or an excellent (M) sports package. It is the only manufacture that has a sport package on all of its cars, even the mighty 740i.  MB and Audi tried to keep up with BMW and lost, I give it Audi that they build a well built car, but it doesn't have the sportiness that the BMW has."
4296,ivan_99,"February 26, 2012 7:59PM","Surprised that nobody is sticking up for the TL SH-AWDI think the SH-AWD is great.  Without switching anything off I was able to slightly over-steer coming out of a corner (if that's your thing).  My current car has an esoteric sequence of commands to turn off the 'nannies'...only to be repeated next time it is started.The TL had a great amount of passenger room, nice dash (I don't mind buttons), and was very compliant over bumps, seams, etc.  As far as acceleration is concerned it is very similar to all the others; really not that different.  Only the 335 felt more lively in day to day driving; felt like all the torque was available 'now'.I like the 'old' beak style as well; didn't purchase one so I guess in a marketing sense it would count as a failure...I ranked it higher than the G37 because it felt more refined and seemed more expensive.  I had the first G...the G35 and had a great time with it.I didn't go with a TL because I decided on a CPO IS350 which was more toss-able and had a lower price (than a new TL).  It had similar refinement as the TL and is RWD; which isn't as great a benefit as some would argue...especially in the IS which tames much of the sportiness the RWD is supposed to bestow...So, if it were up to me in a TL SH-AWD vs G37 I'd go with the TL."
4297,markcincinnati,"February 27, 2012 1:05PM","I made my comparison for my car in the June - Aug 2011 time frame.Acura TL Advance SH AWD (auto, 6 speed)Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + Sport package (auto, 8 speed)Audi S4 Premium with a couple of options to increase content (auto 7 speed)Audi A6 Premium + with additional options to content it like the TL (auto 8 speed)BMW 335x with Premium, Sport, Nav, Bi-Xenons, +sound upgrade (auto 6 speed)Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Luxury Edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifter (auto 6 speed)Infiniti G37X - with every option (auto 7 speed)Infiniti M37X with Premium and Technology (auto 7 speed)Mercedes C class with several of the packages to content it similarly as the A4 or TL (auto 7 speed)Volvo S60 T6 AWD with several packages to get it about to the Audi Prestige or TL Advance level of content (auto 6 speed)I had a lease price number in mind ($600 or less per mo), and I used a service (fee based) called Car Woo to see what the discount off MSRP could be; I also went, in person, to the dealers I test drove and asked for a lease quote at 36 or 39 months 15K miles per year.I bought (leased) the car on September 10.Prior to acquiring the TL, I had narrowed my choices to the cars that offered blind spot warning (BSW) either as part of a package or sold as a separate option.The cars I liked a lot (regardless of BSW):Acura TL (seemed close to an Audi S4 in terms of feel)Audi -- all of themInfiniti M (the G seemed cramped -- I felt like a bug behind the wheel, the thing is so narrow and the hood slopes out of sight, so you can't easily see the front end -- and couldn't be had with BSW)Volvo S60 T6 AWDHonorable mention: Cadillac CTS/4 -- no OMG handles?!? and no BSW, but very American classy and an OK performer -- but not a screamer like the Acura, the Audi S4 or the Volvo S60 T6.Worth noting: the G37X with the sport package did seem a lot of fun -- tons of power, good HUGE paddle shifters and a willingness to go (oddly, rather small wheels and tires, though.)So, if YOU like the power of the Infiniti G and do not feel crammed inside the smallest interior of the bunch (at least it felt that way compared to the Audi and the Acura which at ~72"" wide felt roomy), you should go with the Infiniti -- you are right the Acura is one step away from being ""ugly.""  I like the amount of tech in the Acura and the power is strong -- almost, but not quite S4 strong and the torque vectoring gets rid of the Acura TL understeer.On the other hand the new G, next year (?) will probably alleviate some of the size and content issues I had with it.Regarding the pricing -- the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with backup sensors and splash guards was just south of $48K.  I was offered 13% off MSRP.  The best off MSRP I could get in person was 8%.I made a financial, performance, luxury (content) decision.  Volvo was the worst in terms of an MSRP discount. Infiniti was second best (all from Car Woo, btw.)You can't go wrong with either of your two choices -- but the Acura is not really attractive (when you are on the outside, it is OK when you are on the inside) and the G will be refreshed in about a year (so they say).Purely on performance -- the G.  Purely (for me) on affordability and almost the same performance the TL.I think of the S4 everytime I floor the TL or when I am carving into or out of a curve while applying the throttle.Drive it like you live.  :surprise:"

4299,ivan_99,"February 27, 2012 3:18PM","The CPO does add value...but I suppose that is up to the purchaser to decide if they want to pay for this 'value'.Did you attempt to negotiate?  When I was looking at a CPO 335 coupe they dropped 2k off the MSRP without any real haggling.  I'm not certain if that was their absolute bottom (I assume it wasn't).But of course this was a different dealer, time of year, salesman, state, etc, etc...The BMW CPO (I believe) is transferable too, so that is an added benefit as well.I only find ""WOW"" deals when I'm not looking to buy"
4300,smarty666,"February 27, 2012 6:17PM","So, the G lineup is going to be getting a redesign for the 2013 model year. I was hoping to get some people's thoughts as to what you think Infiniti is going to do to keep the G fresh, innovative, etc. This is especially in light of the new 3-Series with the turbo 4cyl and kick butt mpg.Look forward to hearing the discussion!"
4301,graphicguy,"February 28, 2012 7:03AM",^^^^^Sorry about that....looks like I started into a free-fall ramble with the above post.  I don't get here that often these days.
4302,flightnurse,"February 28, 2012 7:53AM","Currently Infiniti has the G25 for the entry into the G sedan, which also gets better MPG then the thirsty G37. Right now I don't think a turbo 4 is in the works for Infiniti, however they need to raise their CAFE for get fined. Now since Nissan has some great diesels in Europe and Japan, not too sure why they don't bring these engines over to the US.Regarding design, Infiniti has been on a evolution of their cars, so maybe a refresh would help sales."
4303,dbledmndk2,"February 28, 2012 10:12AM",I think we're going to see a bigger difference between the G25 and the G37. Currently the MPG and price differences are too small in my opinion so I wouldn't be surprised to see the G25 end up with a turbo engine and the G37 to continue on its merry way with a new more sporty exterior and LED daytime running lights. I think there are some pictures floating around out there from a recent auto show hinting at the new G coupe - looks a lot sportier like the Nissan Z.
4304,smarty666,"February 28, 2012 4:52PM","I was first really interested in the G25 when it came out, but when I saw the mpg rating (which is the same as a RWD G37) for its size engine, it completely turned me off. I hope Infiniti rectifies it.I agree with the Nissan diesels in other countries, why they don't bring them over. I highly doubt they will, especially with the M hybrid, it seems that, at least Infiniti, is going to do a hybrid as their fuel efficient choice of technology.I agree, Infiniti is much like BMW in doing an evolution of their vehicles rather than a revolution, so I expect only a moderate refresh will be done on the G lineup. If they go in the direction of the essence concept, then they should be in good shape design wise."
4305,smarty666,"February 29, 2012 7:54PM","The G is in its 6th model year, 2007-2012, its due for a redesign. Sales have sagged on the G, and with the new 3 Series, I can't see any logical reason to prolong the redesign into a 7th model year. I don't know of any luxury make bread/butter model, that has gone that long without a moderate-major redesign."

4308,flightnurse,"February 17, 2012 7:19AM",Sweeny you and leases.... Leases are not for everybody and most of the time cost more in the long run then buying a car. To get those ultra low payments come mileage restriction which is you are not careful can add up to thousands of dollars at the end of your lease. Most ultra low leases have a cap of 30K for 3 yrs.
4309,sweendogy,"February 17, 2012 8:18AM","Leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money- I was throwing the option of leasing to our new contributor.  I own 2 cars but have leased in the past when I was less liquid so i think it's a good option. Please spare us with the leader add spew, over have the 3 series sold are leased."
4310,sweendogy,"February 17, 2012 10:33AM","For 400 bux a month - you can get a Acura tsx-yea it's 10k miles a year - but again it's an option for some. A long term lease =what? 3 years are the avg lease deals.  So for 14400 you can get a tsx for 3 years.The point is this may be an option - you need to educate for sure before doing it - just like when you buy a car you should - or sailing a boat.Pretty sure you and nurse - are one and the same when it comes to hateing leasing , which is fine but it is an option for some. No money or little down, smaller payment, works for some. Look at all those 3 series rolling around - you think most are paying cash, financing or leasing those puppies. I'm sure a good % of those people don't make this big bux like you and nurse."
4311,dino001,"February 17, 2012 11:49AM","So for 14400 (10k miles a year ) you can get a tsx for 3 years.Then drive to your friend's house, show it to them, then go to the park, snap a few pictures in a nice scenery, then you park it in your garage and take a bus to work.I rest my case."
4312,flightnurse,"February 17, 2012 5:19PM","Sweeny please do not put words in my mouth. For the record I like leases and for only certain people. I'll give you an example, my sister doesn't drive much, she wants a new car every few years, she can afford the payments. She leased a new CTS last year, got a great deal. $800 out of pocket and $499/m for 3 years, she gets 10K a year for mileage, however she doesn't drive much, about 8K year, so a lease was perfect for her.A lease is not good for someone young because 1) the mileage restriction on leases (however you can negotiate increase mileage into lease payments.) 2) leasing its for everybody."
4313,sweendogy,"February 17, 2012 6:31PM","I love when you say leader add, or ad leader it's great.- all the examples I Have used on leases are from company websites- no where else, not dealers or anything from a local news paper, no local dealers, the actual companies deals. Let's end the leader add agrument as we have proved you are really keen on pointing out. No one said your BMW 328 m package or your 535 that your partner just ordered is a leader ad, but some here have questioned your experimental dealer story you told, I Have not mentioned it was a leader ad situation, so I don't see my problem.  I have questioned why you and Dino are quick to shut down leases - when infact the company you bought a car from leases 50% of those same cars.Again your sisters story, while long, is a great example of a lease that worked for the user- and I was pointing out to the new poster this might be a way to go.  It's a situational thing, some people cant afford to buy a new car every 3 years but can afford to lease those same cars."
4314,nyccarguy,"February 18, 2012 5:04AM","Flightnurse hit the nail right on the head.  Too many people use leasing as a way to get a cheap payment on a more expensive vehicle.  So many people DO NOT understand leasing, but do it using a big capitalized cost reduction & paying the taxes up front (both big no-nos) in order to get a less expensive car payment.  Notice I didn't say cheap.Leasing is more expensive in the long run absolutely.  Some lease for business purposes.  I can tell you 1st hand that my accountant said it is easier to ""write off"" a monthly lease payment than it is to depreciate the value of a vehicle on a yearly basis.Pretty much all of the ELLPS leases I see advertised in the paper are for 10K per year.  There's even a Mercedes Dealer thatif you read the fine printgives a whopping 7500 miles per year.  A lot of people do take these 10K per year leases & go over, but there are people who like to lease a nice new car every 3 years to drive back & forth to the train station.Kyfdx once perfectly said ""leasing should be looked at as an alternate way of financing."". So true.  If you can afford to pay cash or the 60 month car payment on whatever ELLPS you like, but an inflated residual or super cheap money factor that makes your payment a lot less expensive and you can live within the mileage limitations, than go for it."

4321,nkeen,"February 22, 2012 8:02PM","I drove an F30 328i last weekend - a Sportline with 8 speed auto.  My current car is a 2006 E90 325i with sport suspension and 6 speed manual.  Thoughts:1)  The steering is lighter but also feels oddly disconnected on the new car -- it has lost that firm directness I like on the E90.2)  The N20 four banger is powerful but has some lag.  Not as sweet as the less powerful unboosted six.3)  The sports seats in my car can seem like instruments of torture at times.  The new ones are no better -- two pointy things jutting into my kidneys.  Why can't BMW get this right?  VW does in the GTI.4) Although the base pricing is not much more higher than the E90, getting the options I want means buying a lot of superfluous stuff that I don't (for instance a $3,600 package to get HID headlights), so the car ends up being a lot more expensive.I drove a Camaro SS manual with Hurst shifter and FE4 suspension and a Subaru WRX on the same day as the F30.  Both, in their respective ways, were much more fun to drive -- the WRX was a thrill to toss around and had real character.  I'm afraid that BMW might be losing the plot for the sake of the see-and-be-seen audience in the US and anticipated sales volume in China."
4322,nkeen,"February 22, 2012 8:16PM",There was a 328i Modern Line on the floor listing for over $50K.

One problem -- the thermostat failed around 20K -- I guess causing it to run cold, but no symptoms -- found during inspection at the dealership.  I also had the dealer replace the driver's seat under warranty as a crease in the leatherette was starting to show fabric webbing.  The first round of run-flats were a bit brick like, but the technology seems to have improved a lot with the newer tires (Bridgestone RE050As).Whatever its faults, I've owned the 325i far longer than any other car I've had.  It's a beautifully built car, and really still looks close to new.   It feels as though it were made to be driven fast safely, which it was.   I like the original E90 better than its mid-cycle refresh, which seemed to complicate and compromise the lines a bit.  Its predecessors were an Acura TL and a GTI.  I started to dislike the TL almost as soon as I had it -- good engine, but clearly not engineered by people who really understood handling and feel.  Horrible clutch and steering.  I liked the Brazilian built GTI to drive, but it just fell apart piece by piece (transmission, trim, you name it) -- perceived rather than real quality."
4324,flightnurse,"February 23, 2012 7:23AM","The HID headlights are a standalone options for $900. Take look at BMW's web site. The steering can be fixed with the M steering option, however if you wait until July when the M sport package is available that will solve the problems. Before flying out to New York my partner and I stopped off at Chandler BMW, they have two F30's a fully loaded Sportline 335i 57K and a Modern for 48K.  Before I give judgement I want to drive one with the M sport package, since my 2011 has that package. Of course the big push the salesman kept telling us was, you have more power and better fuel economy with the new engine."
4325,sweendogy,"February 23, 2012 9:54AM","i agree- just hearing 57k for a loaded 335 is unreal- the 335xi will be 60k- for a ELLPS- thats a joke- its a great car, dont get me wrong but at that cost you can buy a street in detroit these days."

I think the bigger grip with the tL is its size, shape, performance and most of all looks. If this car was 5k less it's a steal- but it's priced against the g and anyone with a car magazine subscription or a pulse would pick the g - 10 out of 10 times."
4329,plekto,"February 23, 2012 6:28PM","The clutch is actually better with a distinct on/off point.  But the issue with the steering is because it's a front wheel drive car with manual.  There is absolutely no way to fix it or alter the laws of Physics to make it work like a RWD car.  The steering is also extremely dead feeling as far as feedback goes so that you get nothing and then tons of torque-steer in corners. (see Buick for this behavior)Add in lower profile tires than it should be fitted with, plus unidirectional tires that fight each other (each side's tread wants to move the tire outwards) and it's a pretty miserable highway cruiser as well (note GM and Toyota have had this issue - the ""fix"" is to switch to non-directional tires)It's a fancy Avalon.  No surprise that it sucked as a makeshift sport sedan."

The TL seemed cobbled together by some design studio in California based on what focus groups told them constituted a driver's car.  And it came close in many areas.  I wish the BMW was half as comfortable.  Great Honda V6 too."

4333,fedlawman,"February 14, 2012 7:04AM","I don't have a problem with a 4 cylinder BMW - Audi and Mercedes have them. The problem I do have is that NA isn't available anymore.People ranted on and on when the dipstick went away and the cars became ""leasers"" (keep it for 3 years then ditch it) because of the inability to self-maintain them. Shade tree mechanics used to love BMWs, but not these new ones. And now, with a turbo in all of the 3ers, BMW is telling ""don't even think of working on this car yourself."" They might as well remove the hood latch mechanism...As much as I like the engineering, performance, and economy of a turbo-4, I would never buy one."
4334,dino001,"February 14, 2012 7:38AM","Why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in Europe?That's not entirely accurate description of their European offering.  What they have there is lots of different versions and options with their smaller-engine offerings obviously are cheaper to manufacture, but their prices are HIGHER than here - and by higher I mean INSANE.They didn't have there ""old"" 328i (there were 325i and 330i, positioned just below/above in terms of hp, I believe these are same engines as those offered here before 2008), they have 335i just the same.  If you configure one sold in German market to what sells here (largest in Europe), you come up with some ridiculous values.  It would cost you there near double to get similar vehicle, I am not kidding (currency exchange already included).  335i for 100 grand anyone?  A visit in BMW Welts is a real eye opener.  A 1-series with smaller engine than here can cost you there equivalent of a base 5-series here.  If you want to pay what we pay here, you come up with a base NA 4-cyl. engine, cloth seats, no extras of any kind.   So it is not that people buy there 316i because they really want to and they simply don't like 335i, it's basicall most they can afford to buy.  If you add their gas station bill being about double of ours, you get the picture.  Oh no, if  they'd take 328 or 335 in a heart beat if they paid what we pay.People, you don't even realize how tough US market is for those guys and how lucky (demanding) we really are.  They pay labor rates higher than here (especially if you factor in taxes paid by the employer) then they have to come here and sell it for a little more than half the price they'd command in their domestic market.  If you realize that, you wonder how they are able to sell anything here at a profit and still offer decent (perhaps not great) choices.On the flip side, there everybody gets choices upon choices, even in lower end brands.  A typical 3-series price sheet is two pages here for a given body style, there it's a twenty-plus page booklet just for the same body style.  People rarely buy from dealer's lots, they order and pick it up three to six months later.  They often can't really test drive the car with engine they order (that's regardless of brand).  Totally different experience."
4335,qbrozen,"February 14, 2012 8:27AM","OK, but what is the overall cost of living and average income? I mean, if we're talking US dollars here, is it just a matter of the US dollar being worth far less there?

Know what I mean?I know this is going back a ways, but I know base Benzes, for example, served taxi duty. I would guess that's because they are relatively cheap, no? Does that still hold true today?

Dr. Hans or Dept. Manager Jaques have vastly better life - they live in 1500 sf house and commute in three-year-old Ford Mondeo/Peugeot 405 with 140 hp engine, also diesel.

There are big advantages of straight six in terms of balance, smoothness, power delivery.  Sure, you can make a screamer 4-cyl sewing machine producing same power as a larger I6, but the experience is not the same.   Long term durability is also an open question.  Europeans are already going through that now with their modern diesel engines - in quest of clean quite and high power turbo diesel, all advantages of old diesel (resiliency, low maintenance, million mile durability) are all but gone.  Pour wrong fuel to your tank and you need new injectors.  Put wrong oil and watch your car die...  Sure, they are all nice, clean and quiet when new, but they last just about the same as gasoline engines, but still cost 30% more."

The oil cooler is bent out of shape. We didn't see any evidence of frame damage, but the glove box doesn't close properly anymore, leading me to suspect more unseen damage. There are numerous light paint scratches all over the passenger side of the car. I haven't driven it, but the engine runs, there are no new leaks, and the rear wheels are still attached to the crank, so that's something.Most of the expense from the bodyshop estimate is because they would replace body panels and have to paint the entire car to get a good blend. Do a four-wheel alignment and then insurance added $2500 for additional unseen work that is expected to be needed. Total estimate to repair is $15K - $17.5K.I'm considering buying the Salvage and piecing it back together myself. USAA wants $4200 for it and I'm sure I could fix it for a lot less by bending things back into position, buying bumpers online and having MAACO paint them, etc...Part of me knows it will never be the same and I'll think of my brother whenever I drive it.

He drove it back to back with the 2.0T and really preferred the way the 3.2 behaved.  He's not an enthusiast, just likes European cars.There used to be a ""4 cylinder stigma"" that I don't know exists anymore in certain circles.  Fuel economy is on everyone's mind these days (and has been for quite some time now).  I always enjoy a good car conversation outside of my enthusiast friends.  People used to talk about acceleration & horsepower.  Now the first question you hear someone ask when someone else gets a new car is:  ""How is it on gas?""I wonder what kind of crazy incentives BMW will offer on the E90 335 & 328 xi before the new F30 Xi models come out.  Cash?  Low financing?"

I love, but would not get one for 18 grand, especially if did not have more money to spend after the purchase.If maintenance costs are real issue for you, start with Acura TSX or TL.  TL is definitely more luxurious, but more expensive and larger; you'd get newer TSX. TSX is smaller, but also more agile and better on gas.  TL is basically luxury version on Accord.  TSX is a top line of European/JDM car also called Honda Accord, but it's a different vehicle altogether.My second choice for low maintenance entry level/semi luxury would be 2005-2010 Subaru Legacy GT or 3.6R (the last letters are important - it's a turbo version or 6-cylinder of Legacy, respectively).  GT is very fast and has 6-speed manual transmission (if that's important to you), not so great on gas and may be hard to find. Legacy 3.6R Limited has a smooth 6-cylinder engine and AT and also decent level of equipment.Third choice - Infiniti G35.  For 18 grand, it may already be too old to be ""problem free""."

Here in Phoenix, 99% of all 3 series cars (non M cars) are sold with automatics, the GM wanted to see if he ordered a 328i with M sport package, (leather was a free option on my 328) xenon head lights, keyless access, cold weather package, moon roof would sell, and it did't not sale, it sat on the lot for 5 months. I must have hit the showroom at the right time, that is why I got the smoking deal.  So yes most base 328 with very little options are selling at mid to low 20s. BTW, the average buyer can not get cars at auction prices so that is a mood point. So currently at one of the local BMW dealers in Phoenix, has 2 BMW 328s with the M sport package with 40 and 49K miles are asking 28 and 30K for them. Mine will have less then 40K and keep in pristine condition with all the right option."

Even with dealer incentives, it's still five grand below dealer cost.  Wow, on that I can only say your it sounds just too good to be true, but since you say you got it, congratulations and kudos.Now, on the resale:  I'm no expert, I just sold a three year old car last week.  First, the fact that dealers post $30K on something, doesn't mean you can sell same thing for that.  Buyers don't care about auction prices, but dealers do when they take a trade.  If you want to sell it individually, be prepared for weeks of no phone calls interrupted by text messages from people wanting to give you less that dealer would.  I just went through that personally just in last month.  Finally I sold it, but the reality was quite painful.  You may have more patience and you obviously have more luck than me, so who knows.Well, it is funny you said about the ""experiment"" car.  That's very close to what I got (no M package, but regular sports package, convenience pkg and Nav).  The car was about $46.5K MSRP.  Nowhere near your discount, but it was ordered, so no reason to go below costs either."
4355,flightnurse,"February 9, 2012 5:07PM","dino I can only say the ""experiment"" was the word the GM used to me, I had no reason not to believe him, why would the car sit on the lot for 5 months with no bites. the Color combo was great, the options were right on the mark, except it was a manual and not an auto."
4356,dino001,"February 9, 2012 5:34PM","Again, manual is just for me.  Now, if I could only believe somebody would take 5+ grand loss just to get rid of it. I did some basic math.  $47K MSRP car is about $44K invoice.  Then we may have dealer incentive (2011 is last year of the model), say 2 grand or so.  So to get to $39K OTD we have price at $35K-$36K.  That's possible 6 grand hit.   Say there is another thousand or two lying around with the mfr - still 4 grand loss.  Dealer finances inventory at say 6 APR on their revolving account (maybe more, I don't know, but it seems reasonable).  Car is $43 or so invoice, which means it cost the dealer about 2.5 grand to finance it over full year. Why would one take this hit after just five months?  Is there something you want to tell us?"

I didn't realize you had a stick. So the $22k is probably generous.You apparently don't understand depreciation as you said you did because you failed to realize my main point, which is that most options add zero-to-very-little value to a used car.BTW, the average buyer can not get cars at auction prices so that is a mood [sic] point.Thanks for that.

Dealers do the same thing. That's a sort of joke I've told before, and complained to salespeople about, too... they'll tell me ""nobody wants it"" when trading it to them, but then its ""rare/hard to come by!"" when buying it from them.

Right on the money!dino - I know the ride, build quality (solidness), RWD handling balance are very different between your 328iT & your WRX STi, but how are you holding up with the severe power differences between the 2 cars.Q - I totally agree with you regarding the auction values of cars, that's what you get from the dealer whether it is a 10/10 or a 7/10.  They deduct more if the car is in rough shape and don't add so much if the car is truly exceptional.Sometimes, if you have the perfect car for the perfect buyer, things can work out in both of your favors.  Back in 1998, when we graduated college a friend of mine had to have a Mustang Convertible with a stick.  He special ordered a V6 (VEE SIX) Mustang Convertible with a stick.  We tell him he's NUTS because everyone who wants a Mustang with a Stick Shift is going to want a GT (V8) & he's going to have a lot of trouble selling the car when the time comes.To say my friend is anal about how he keeps his cars is and understatement.  He also made it look like a GT (Dual Exhaust, Rear Bumper to Integrate dual exhaust, fake hood scoop...).Fast forward to 2003.  He Special orders a MINI Cooper S.  His MINI comes in and he starts looking into selling his Faux GT V6 5 SPeed Mustang Convertible.  I do some research for him & tell him that given the way domestics depreciate & given his car is a complete odd ball to expect to get maybe $11K TOPS for the car.He lists it himself anyway after getting trade in offer of like $10-$10,5 (Plus paying full sticker for the MINI).  He gets a call from some 16 year old kid who wants a Mustang with a stick, but insurance (& his parents) prohibits him from buying a V8.  He likes the stick, the convertible, (Mom Likes the V6), & most importantly the faux GT styling.  I think my friend got $16K for his car."

They'll hold on to a 328i like you describe, use it as a loaner, or a demo.  But, dealers sell just about all the ones they can get their hands on.  IF you bought it at $7K-$8K off MSRP, the option list may not be what is reported, or it has a bunch of miles on it as a demo/loaner.BTW.....took my 3er in to have the oil changed (6K miles, paid for it out of my own pocket....next one is on BMW), and they let me drive a '12 328i sedan.  Interesting with a  4 cy...drive train's a lilttle rough.... uncharacteristic of a BMW.

If those seats were sold separately, I'd get them and could live with all-season rubber,  on standard rims., normal suspension and speed limit at 130 (although I got it to 138 mph on German autobahn, but well)What's funny is realization than when compared with sedan, the wagon is actually cheaper, even though it starts higher.  Sedan doesn't have standard fold down seats ($500, which is absolutely ridiculous - what's worse I noticed dealers actually don't order them - can only imagine surprise on somebody's face first time they try to fold seats  :sick: ), is also has no sunroof (which I understand tall people may actually prefer not to have).

4376,shipo,"January 12, 2012 11:19AM","Smoothness comes in two flavors, the first is engine balance, and the second is power delivery.Engine Balance:- The only match I know of for an I-6 in this metric is an H-4, an H-6, or a V-12.  Pretty much every other engine configuration suitable for an automobile will develop ordered vibrations at some level.Power Delivery:- Engines of the 4-Stroke / 4-Cylinder (or fewer) variety suffer from noticeable ""torque reversal"" events; in the case of the four pot motor, there are two such events per revolution of the crank.  What is a ""Torque Reversal"" event?  A state where the power delivery of the last cylinder to fire has waned to the point where it can no longer sustain engine rotation and when the next cylinder to fire has yet to wax to the point where it can sustain said rotation.  Considering 4-Stroke engines apply over 90% of their power between a point twenty degrees after TDC and twenty degrees before BDC, there are two forty degree periods per rotation of the crank where the engine mechanicals and the flywheel are driving the engine.Remediation:- The remediation of natural engine imbalance of I-4 engines has been known for a very long time, simply keep displacement to roughly two liters or less and apply two (im)balance shafts rotating at twice engine RPM (one to either side of the block), and the natural vibrations of the engine are effectively cancelled out.- The remediation of torque reversal events is both easier and not as complete; it is easier because the manufacturer only needs to add a heavier flywheel to effectively dampen out the events.  The thing is, dampening isn't as ""complete"" (for lack of a better word) as cancelling; the torque reversals will always be there, it will just be very difficult to sense them.Final thoughts:All intermittent combustion engines exhibit torque peaks and valleys, even the monster 18 cylinder R-2800 ""Double Wasp"" and the even monsterer 28-Cylinder R-4360 ""Wasp Major"".  That said, once beyond the 6-Cylinder threshold the ""valleys"" don't step into the realm of negative torque and are thus imbued with a property called ""smoothness"".  Six cylinder engines, even BMW's vaunted I6 models, do venture briefly into the negative torque territory three times per revolution, but the excursion below the line of zero torque is so shallow and so short in duration, they too have been given accolades for their smoothness.For my part, if BMW's new(ish) turbocharged 2.0 liter I-4 is engineered to be ""only as smooth"" as the 2.0T in our new GTI, it will be more than smooth enough for me."

Heated seats $0. HIDs $0. Etc. And all of this is independent of age, to an extent. Those are the same values whether the car is 2 months or 2 years old. They start going down after about year 5 or so, in most situations."
4396,dino001,"February 8, 2012 2:13PM","The idea of buying used cars is great, the problem with it is that there were no cars matching my list anywhere within 2 thousand miles - in fact there are not cars even close to one I wanted.  Manual tranny - nope, wagon - nope, combined - forget it.  So I got a new one.  Of course I (over)paid, but did it willingly.  When I spent 45 grand this Fall, I decided that the car will be EXACTLY the way I want it, as long as it is available - not close, not more-less, exactly.  And it had all those ""full depreciation"" items: Nav, HID (part of convenience package), sports package.  I was initially against 2-grand Navigation, thought Garmin would do, but they dropped the price by $600 when combined with Premium package, making the price more pallatable.My general stance on depreciation I don't care, because I buy a car for myself, not the next owner.  I also like to keep it 6 to 8 years, as long as it's in good shape and has no major issues.  At that point the depreciation is not such a big issue anyway . Doesn't always work this way; as a matter of fact, just traded a three-year-old Subaru STI, but that one was from the get-go intended to be a transition car. BTW, the depreciation came out just great, as I paid in November '08 $33K with all taxes and fees (even got no-interest loan on top) and sold it last week for $22.8K - less than $300/month!).   So it worked out, even though I didn't care about it.Don't expect a similar miracle with my 328i wagon though. But again - as long as it stays in shape, I'll keep it.  Until now there was always ""the next car"", even at the very moment of purchase.  This time there is no ""next car"" for me, not from what they have to offer.  Perhaps, if Audi brings S4 wagon again (but they won't), or the new 3-series Gran Turismo (MY 2013 and beyond) comes in 335i flavor and manual tranny (which it probably won't), or they go really crazy and make M3 or M5 in some hatchback/wagon flavor (which they won't)."
4397,qbrozen,"February 9, 2012 8:26AM","HOwever if you buy the car with cash then you don't have much to worry about.That, of course, has nothing to do with depreciation.I do not plan on keeping the 2011 for 6 yrs, 4 tops.6 years isn't bad. 4 years isn't so great. You definitely get hit hard in that case.So some people like to buy new and some do not, there is not a right or wrong choice here.Well, of course people can do whatever they want with their money. If someone wants to waste more, that is their perogative. I certainly have no right to preach. I am quite wasteful myself on my car spending .... just not nearly as wasteful as I would be if I purchased new."

I'm grateful to those that load up their new vehicles and take a bath 2 years later.The group you are talking to now [sic] the ins and out [sic] of depreciationYou certainly can't speak for everyone. Actually, MOST people don't realize the depreciation of options. So, again, I was offering up a SUGGESTION, along with some historical data. You certainly don't need to gives a rat's bum about my advice. Again, that's your perogative. I didn't offer it for your exclusive benefit.By the way, you won't be selling a 4-year-old 328i for $30k.

""Can't we all just get along?""Like I stated, I've only bought (or leased) new cars since the glorious day I got my license back in August 1992.  I'm happy with my 2010 Acura TSX as a DD (could use more power, hydraulic steering, & MUCH better brakes), but am not head over heels in love with it (like I am my 2001 Prelude Type SH).  My TSX was also a car that I bought originally for my wife with Cash 4 Clunkers money that I knew I'd be driving on the weekend, but not every day.  This changed when we decided to have a 3rd child and now needed a bigger vehicle.  Bought her a 2011 Pilot, The 2010 TSX becomes my DD, & my beloved Prelude gets driven once or twice a week (yes it gets the garage with the Pilot).I'm always thinking (building online & checking out used car values) about what's next.  I know the financially smart thing to do is to pay off the TSX (just refinanced), and drive it with no payment until the wheels fall off.  Cars are my ""thing.""  I've been hooked on BMWs ever since I drove a friend's '95 E36 325is (stick, sport) through the streets of Buffalo one winter night when I was in college.  I leased my wife an '07 X3 and just loved the way it drove.  It was never in the shop once except for scheduled maintenance.With 3 kids and a mortgage, I think it would be selfish of me to go out and buy an almost $50K car (328xi or X3).  If in a few years, I can muster together a small down payment, then I can convince the board of directors (my wife) that this Mid to high used $20K BMW (X3 or 328xi) is what i want and I think it'll last, then I'll go for it!  Life's way too short to drive boring cars."
4400,qbrozen,"January 9, 2012 11:54AM","Well, the tendency to understeer is of course relative to the car. Not all do. And for those that do, a rear swaybar upgrade can take care of that, as can, to some degree, a front/rear differential in tire pressures (higher pressure in the rear will add oversteer).The biggest advantage to AWD on the track, IMHO, is being able to get on the power much earlier and harder. Traction coming out of turns is critical, and, obviously, you get much more power down to the road with AWD.My personal experience was with my G35x compared to all other vehicles I've autocrossed. I did not have to be at all careful with the X. Just all gas or all brakes and nothing in between. With every vehicle since, I've had to train my right foot to wait and then modulate."
4401,nyccarguy,"January 9, 2012 12:49PM","So than for your average non-tracking driver who enjoys on/off ramps & twisty back roads, the only advantage of AWD is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces?"
4402,sweendogy,"January 9, 2012 2:49PM",Nsx does look pretty cool. I don't know anything about the RL as it wasn't mentioned in anything I read about the auto show or on the Acura website. The new entry level caddy looks promising - lighter then most packing a 300hp eng.

4404,alltorque,"January 10, 2012 4:08AM","This is a huge topic and lots of variables so probably no simple, definitive, answer.As a simple soul I'd try, (and probably fail), to categorize as follows :Given that the driver is reasonably competent in all cases then RWD takes some beating on a good dry track and the car can be beautifully ""balanced"" into/out of corners.  On the rough stuff - gravel, forest tracks, (e.g. typical WRC special stages), or very wet conditions/snow etc then AWD will have advantages simply by having drive at all four corners.  Then we get into weight distribution and front engine, mid-engine, rear engine configurations.  Early Porsches were pretty quick but, in the hands of the unwary the engine hanging out the back would generally try and overtake the front of the car without much warning. Of course, a world class driver in either a FWD or RWD car will outperform an idiot in an AWD car, (of similar performance).That's the simple version - probably."

We're entering a period where ""less is more"" insofar as our choices in autos goes.It used to be only ""bigger is better"" and that only the big cars got the ""more is more"" treatment.I had (or my wife had, better said) three Audi TT's, the last two were the high performance models (at the time) with the 225HP 4 cylinder (1.8).Due to a timing issue, I had the distinct ""pleasure"" (not really) of having her last TT as my daily driver for a month or so.God, I felt like a bug when I drove it on I-71 in rush hour. A big semi (with trailer) would damn near blow me away -- or so it felt.Now the car was nimble and very peppy and all that -- but damn, get me the hell outta here!

Less is more, indeed.Can't wait to come up with some excuse to test the new 3 series -- but I will, of course, await the X-drive model, as I simply wouldn't even consider 2WD period.Best time ever, to be in the market -- yup!Drive it like you live.  :shades:"

Obviously, the dealer understands you are more educated about the potential vehicle, and that you are less willing to settle for something less than what you want.The big drawback, of course, is the waiting period, and the uncertainty of the trade in value at the time of actual delivery."
4425,nyccarguy,"January 3, 2012 12:18PM","Excellent posts guys.How fast can we really go on our public roads?  How much power do we really need?  We're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.I live in Connecticut & Commute to The Bronx 6 days a week.  The roads I drive on have mostly 50 mph (in NYC) & 55 mph (Westchester & CT).  There's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway I take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit!  2 of my cars (Prelude & TSX) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines.  Guess what?  I seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80.  If I slide my TSX shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.I've got my Prelude Type SH as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance ramp attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that I drive to work once a week now.The TSX is my daily driver.  As much as I love driving my Prelude, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seats, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic.  My wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids.  She prefers driving the TSX solo as opposed to her 2011 Pilot which she chauffers the kids around in all week.  It is nice to have 2 automatic transmission cars.I do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different cars in this class.No way would I even consider a G25X, only a Sport/Nav/Premium G37X.With a BMW, the only way I could even think of affording a 335Xi is if it is a CPO car.  Then I'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this CPO 335xi over a brand new optioned as I want 328xi?  With the upcoming320i w/ X drive328i 2.0L Turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.When the time comes, I'd have to check out the C350 as well.  Who knows, BMW may have botched the electric power steering (it isLIFELESSin my TSX)?  Maybe MBs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 L V6 would be a better fit for my daily commute.  I might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too.  MBUSA's headquarters (as well as BMWUSA's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an MB Executive Demo car that's RWD instead of the run-of-the mill C300 4Matics that every dealership stocks.  Maybe if I LOVE the Mercedes that much, I could live with a RWD car in CT.  I'd be willing to live with MB Text instead of the full leather.There's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the G37's engine.  Fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their G37 Sedan.It is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their cars & have been to driving schools too."
4426,markcincinnati,"January 3, 2012 1:31PM","I have been to three Audi (in Seefeld Austria) driving schools and one BMW driving school (here in the US in South Carolina).  Both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""comfortably.""I drive my 305HP TL so slowly on Interstate 71S on the way to downtown Cincinnati, I rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.We had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our State Highway Patrolmandu jourabout how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the Audi and BMW driving schools even if they never use that term).  The first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is NOT equipped with ABS (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with ABS vs non-ABS, the interview was cut short.As I watched this interview unfold, I grew angry since the response from the cop was to NOT press hard on the brakes without ABS and I knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have ABS . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""If anyone was about 75% paying attention, I would think they would press on their ABS equipped car's brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal.  Of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!What is the % of ABS equipped cars?  I've had it in all my cars since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.Why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?Oh crap, I'm way off topic.Hmmm, let's see -- OK, I've got it.All ELLPS and LPS (and most other cars on the market today) have BOTH ABS and Electronic Stability Control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!Whew, hopefully I saved it.

The deep well of Torque available at most any RPM, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that I find quite satisfying.Though I relish those occasions when I can apply WOT for more than a few seconds, I also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or drama.  There is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the Corvette I drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.This applies to the handling, as well.

4430,nyccarguy,"January 4, 2012 11:35AM","I plan on waiting until my TSX is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a CPO F30 328i w/ XDrive when the time comes.I too love pretty much everything about the current E90 3, including all the little details you listed.  It is just too small for my needs.  With 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving dynamics & rapid acceleration, I need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior.  A stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an E90.  A child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling.  A rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.We had an '07 X3.  It had tons of rear seat room for child safety seats (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the comfort of the front passenger.  Reliability wise, the car was perfect.  Only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time.  With 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb.  She took out 2 tires and a wheel.  She also needed an alignment to go with it.  The service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldn't pass BMW lease end inspection and that I should replace them.  I also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the X3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.I should have bought the X3 at its lease end with it's brand new tires and stellar reliabiliy record.  Plus I LOVED driving it.  I had the TSX which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that I didn't want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old BMW with 46,000 miles.  I had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so I figured keeping the Acura was a safe bet.  Plus I wasn't thrilled with the X3's cargo room.  The Acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.Like I've said before, I like the TSX.  A lot.  It just isn't a car I picked out to be my daily driver.  I inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a Pilot.  When the time comes to replace the TSX, I'm most certainly going to replace it with a BMW."

4435,sweendogy,"January 5, 2012 6:12PM",I agree vw does have a nice 800 miles per tank thing going but in reading consumer reports they were amazed by how slow to 60 the car is - its 10 seconds to 60. ( I think the one they tested was auto). Diesel is something we should move forward on - torque - and Mpgs but in order to tickle my fancy they need to go- which I believe BMW 335 diesel has this pull we are looking for but I would need stick and awd as an option living in the north east.
4436,nyccarguy,"January 5, 2012 8:05PM","shipo:  My Aunt & Uncle live in Southern, NH (Salem), very close to you.  You also know I have a tremendous amount of respect for your opinion and vast knowledge, especially when it comes to all things automotive.  You guys get some serious snow.  Much more than we do here in Stamford, CT.  I've lived in NY all my life (Rockland, Ithaca, Manhattan, Westchester) and much like MA & NH, they plow & salt.  Early and often.I thought the weather here in Stamford would be exactly the same as in Southern Westchester (Hartsdale, White Plains) where I had moved from.  I was very much mistaken.  Now I will admit that we had a ""bad winter"" last year as far as snowfall goes.  Here in Stamford, I live off The Merrit Parkway and many people have well water, so they DO NOT salt the roads.  They also don't send the plows out like they do in NY.  I've got to be at work at 7:30 AM.  That means leaving at 6:30 on normal days and between 6:00 & 6:15 when it snows.  Last year I saw a few times that they had done a few passes on The Merrit, but didn't plow the entrance/exit ramps.  I actually followed a plow on the the parkway thinking I'd be able to get off at the next exit and turn around.  Well, I had to drive 10 miles North to Norwalk before I could turn around and come back south.  This was all in my 2001 Honda Prelude equipped with a set of Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires.I think AWD with a set of 4 snow tires would have helped me plow through some of those unplowed on ramps and made my life easier.For years I thought AWD/4WD was not needed in the ""tri-state"" area.  That RWD and a set of winter tires would be all my whatever bmw I was building online would need.  AWD adds weight & cost.  It hampers fuel economy & performance for the other 355 days a year that it doesn't snow.  AWD helps you start, but the added weight can be your enemy trying to swerve around something and increased your stopping distance.  After spending 1 (bad) winter here in Stamford (southwestern CT for those who are unfamiliar with the area), my tune has changed.I equip my FWD Acura TSX with 4 Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires.  My next car will hopefully be a BMW.  I'd love an X1 (gas or diesel), a CPO X3 (N55 Turbo), or an F30 328i w/ X drive."
4437,shipo,"January 6, 2012 3:26AM","Ahh, sorry.  We test-drove a Passat TDI 6-Speed as well; not as quick as the Golf, but it did feel quicker than ten seconds to sixty.  That said, I believe the 2.0 TDI is a bit under powered for a car the size of the Passat."
4438,dino001,"January 6, 2012 5:38AM","Diesels feel quick until you reach the revvs above the band and it ""dies"" very quickly.  This means you have to shift a lot very precise shift points - this will impact acceleration number like 0-60.  However, highway acceleration numbers (like 45 mph-60 mph, or 50-70 mph) usually are very good with diesels and make them feel quick and powerful."

4440,markcincinnati,"January 6, 2012 1:30PM","I loved your post, but I must take exception to something kind of buried in your prose, to wit:""It hampers fuel economy & performance. . .""I don't really want to get into a discussion about the merits of AWD vs RWD or FWD or the difference between 2 driven and 4 driven wheels -- however, therefore, notwithstanding (and any other lawyer-ly sounding thing), I do agree that AWD done poorly can hamper performance.  I agree that typically (meaning virtually always in fact) the added weight of AWD does decrease fuel mileage.Yet we don't live (or at least most of us don't live) in a perfect world with respect to driving -- if we did, I suspect virtually everyone would agree that RWD at least ought to be the best.Assuming we all accept the premise that our driving world is imperfect, I would submit that AWD generally speaking (and with the qualifier that I am speaking about AWD done well, such as by Audi, BMW and Infiniti, wherein the AWD is rear biased and may include torque vectoring or what is sometimes called a sport differential) performs better in the real world.My premise is that AWD is not just about driving in the snow and on other low coefficient of friction surfaces.We can, if you like, agree to disagree and be done with it -- I just couldn't let the ""hampers performance"" remark stand since it seems too broad and perhaps would lead a newcomer to this forum to come to believe that only RWD is good and AWD sucks gas and decreases performance.For a lot of folks, even in warmer areas of the country, AWD means the potential for greater perfomance in everyday driving circumstances.Drive it like you live.:shades:"

I would suggest you check out the turbo desil -Gets 700 miles per tank,  but given your last posts the torque and potential sound coming from the engine might get you sideways. Does it come standard with 18's?"

The reason we pay extra for premium cars because want have style, comfort and good qaulity materials in interior and most of them perform well too. All those mainstream cars style range from ugly to boring and interior from ugly to cheesy. Nobody mention Volvo S60 so far btw. I find it is cramped."
4450,fedlawman,"December 31, 2011 6:12PM","I optioned both cars the way YOU listed in your post (#12838):""Price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers.""I then explained that I don't like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the Mercedes I would personally order costs $41,450.So, how is it on me that Infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? They do it on purpose to FORCE the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. Do you think it's an accident that in order to get the Sport Package, you also have to order the Navigation Package? That's $4000 for a laundry list of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your G37 to handle and stop a little better. :confuse:So, if I were to buy a G37, I would have to pass on the Sport Package and simply get the Journey + Premium Package for $39,245. That's only $2000 less than the Mercedes. Every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the G37 (which is it's strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.So how did this happen? Mercedes offers the C350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. This serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. Yes, if you want metallic paint on a European car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the Shiatsu Massage and Curb Feeler Packages to get it.And enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. In this era of 300 hp family cars and 400 hp pony cars, 328 hp is nothing to brag about. If you really spend that much time in the left lane, I hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often.   :P"

4455,dino001,"December 31, 2011 10:35PM","MB and BMW are more expensive for comparable equipment. One could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to G or TL, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries.However, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and C-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon).  There is really no excuse for that - 12K Kia and Hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse.  It's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" BS.  I know, I have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding seats and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. What makes it worse, I see dealers actually ordering those without folding seats in large numbers.  I can only imagine a brand new owner of 50K 335 trying to fold his/her seats and discovering the car doesn't have it.  :sick:  :lemon:On many other options, I'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling).  I tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering), but bundling sports package with Nav is a little too much,   even if I would order both anyway.  To me it's OK to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports.  But cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both.For value-oriented people probably nothing beats Acura - you get everything except Nav/technology.  I like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose  :lemon:.  We still don't have it so bad here -  you would have to see a price sheet on BMW in Europe - it's actually a book!!! Proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional.  Of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely.  Not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50K+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there)."
4456,fedlawman,"January 1, 2012 3:08AM","I discovered an error in my research. I'm not sure what I did, but the  above described C350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (Edit: the $1750 leather seats didn't get added in)I also just noticed that when I added the wood trim to the G37, it automatically added the $1200 Technology Package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. Since these are standard features on the C350, this doesn't change the math in my previous post.The increase in the price of the C350 raises the gap between the Merc and Infiniti up to about $3150.However, something else occurred to me...Take the well equipped C350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, comfort, safety, or functionality.The same C350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!Now do the same thing with the above described G37 and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the Technology Package requires the wood trim. OK, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, they're part of the Sport Package that includes the upgraded suspension. Leather seats are standard, so that's not an option. OK, I hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? Sorry, it's part of the Premium Package which includes driver memory settings and Bose premium audio.The C350 now costs $350 less than the G37.

I'm still experimenting with it so they're a little rough...Yes, I was very surprised to discover how much value is actually in the C350. Pretty cars, and impressive performance and safety too. I would never actually buy one though - too much technology to fail a few years down the road and too expensive to fix.I am excited about the upcoming 328i though. I've never really liked the E90, but this F30, with significantly more power (torque!) and less weight, has the potential to be a real game changer. I predict it will steal a lot of 335i sales and be THE sales and value leader in this segment. I also think it's much better looking than the E90. And following current industry trends, it should also be less expensive than the E90.If options are anything like the 2011 model, a base model 6-speed MT with a moonroof and heated seats (a la carte!) should sticker for between $36K and $37K.Do you think my wife will like it?"

I do not (and really don't plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).So I go through German and now Japanese ""luxury performance sedans"" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport seats, sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. I used to fight the good fight and order cars specifically so that I could get manual shifters. I chipped my turbo cars, changed out the air filters and BPV's to squeeze out any additional power I could (from the turbo's of course).For what?A quick dash to 35MPH, before I had to abruptly mash the brake pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me!  That's what.I read the reviews of the new BMW 328 (with the turbo 4), and I really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when I saw the acceleration figures -- but then I thought, ""I probably can't even use that much power on the entrance ramp to I-71S"" (I'd rear end someone.)Nevertheless I continue to want more -- I want my cars to be ever quicker (they're already fast, even the puny ones can go 130MPH, which is where many of the Germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequently) being able to enjoy the ever quickening acceleration from the Americans, Europeans and the Japanese.I want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time I can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally Bambi.)I have become irrational about the performance -- I want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the cars I drive. Perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 Audi S6. At least, way back then, I could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.Now I am driving a car that is as fast as any on this board and faster than many.  Moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too.  Good luck in being able to actually enjoy the performance.Yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, I am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more technology next time?Completely irrational.I'm thinkin' the evolution of the new BMW 3 (in the next 30 months) or the G from Infiniti (and possibly another Acura) or maybe back to my old love, Audi will provide more more more.  By then, however, I'd imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin' awesome!""Drive it like you live (or rather, as you wouldliketo live).:confuse:"

If I can sit in the driver's seat and reach across to the passenger's window, I feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ELLPS class.  The A4 has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in legroom), as has the upcoming BMW 3 -- and the TL is damn near 5 series or A6 size.  The G, for me, makes me feel like a bug.When I get behind the wheel of a G, I feel like I did the first time I got into a Ford Econoline van, I mean I feel like I am sitting on the front bumper.Now, the Infiniti in my garage is a 2011 FX35 Premium in black gloss with a java interior. I feel like I am piloting the hulk when I drive it.  It feels big, powerful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time.  I also got that feeling from my many test drives of an M37X. I would have had an M were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.I would suspect little will change for a few more years in the M's, since they are only 2 MY old.  The corporate grill that has been added to the FX's makes me believe that the FX line will be refreshed perhaps in '13 or '14 MY. And, I assume the G's are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.Driving Audis, BMWs and Infinitis, I can tell you that the phrase Japanese BMW is an appropriate descriptive term for Infiniti. Infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a BMW stand out.Acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a little bit like -- the Japanese Audi (from a few years ago) in that they don't hide their Honda-ness any better than Audi used to hide its VW parentage.  If Acura were to ditch the Honda ""tells"" ASAP and make the Acura brand ""stand alone"" (as Audi has done from VW), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of unique brand identity (which is largely lacking, currently.)Of course, it also wouldn't hurt one little bit if Acura would hire a designer or three away from one of the companies that makereal purty 'sheens.Hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of Infiniti from any reliable source, but, that's it!Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, etc.Drive it like you live.:shades:"

Infiniti made a gamble with the G and it turned out - Please look at acura sales numbers and tell me again they are not struggling.. Again they sold less TL's the year they changed the body then the year before.2) no idea what your talking about- i think we can all agree why cars are offered with incentives3) My loaner comment was based on the fact it was a V6 TSX. not a TSX.4) you can use google to find out what car companies are going with products- I know infiniti had gone to bed with MB on an engine which might be in the next G and that worries me.. another thing is the new truck thats coming is a FWD platform which again worries me.  I think if infiniti wants to keep its traction is going to have to release a car in the next 2 years as BMW is going live on a new 3 for 2012.."

Sure, we're talking about ELLPS cars here, but I don't think that suggests that we're not interested in performance.I am interested in these cars, at this point in time, due to the fact that they give their owners most of the """"L"" of the LPS cars and almost all of the ""P"" (or at least they seem to have up until now.)If Acura wants to no longer persue ""P"" does that mean they will focus more on ""L""?  I mean how can you remain in the Premium class if you are not either heavy on the ""L"" (Lexus and often Mercedes comes to mind) or heavy on the ""P"" (and Audi and BMW -- and sometimes even Cadillac -- spring to mind).It seems Acura is attempting to prep me (if I can be prepped, that is) to accept ""good cars,"" since we're no longer going to even try to make great cars (insofar as lux and/or performance is concerned.)The 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance seems to embody a lot of performance and a lot of luxury (in the ELLPS world, I mean) at a good price.  My TL's content for the dollar seems high -- considering, too, that Acura seems more willing to deal on the selling price than, say, Volvo or Audi.As I read the variety of ""press release"" type of communications coming out of Acura these past couple of days, they seem to be saying -- we're going to have 5 really good cars and 1 super car to choose from. We are going to build, mostly, ""really good cars"" -- we're going to focus on value, green-ness and that Acura DNA (whatever that is).They continue by saying, ""Our customers tell us they don't buy our cars first and foremost for performance -- and even a great sound system is #5 on our surveyed customer's list.""I am interested in hearing from you on this topic and others and about other manufacturers.  Hell, I'd bet I've had more Audis that the vast majority of folks and I would be glad, damn glad, to chat and opine and bloviate on that subject too.Let's get back to talking about the cars.

I remember once I got a license 16 years ago the car I wanted was a legend coupe 6 speed, with the souped up Type2? Engine.I settled for a 89 maxima which in itself was a great car but not thelooker the Acura. My first new car was a 2000 Acura integra gs-r coupe-redline was almost 9k Rpms and I took it to that level every day- loved the car and the service.

4567,fedlawman,"December 19, 2011 7:28AM","I wanted a Legend so badly when it first came out. And the 2nd gen Legend Coupe - still gorgeous even today.When I was in college my girlfriend's dad had a Vigor. I thought it was very nice at the time too.The TSX is very much like a modern day Vigor - only it performs better in every way.It's not that Acura has lost it's way. The TSX, TL, RL were a very logical lineup for a near-luxury brand. Time has simply marched on and Acura hasn't kept up. They cannot use the Accord as a platform for their entire lineup any longer, and they cannot market any Civic-based car as an Acura.A three-car lineup moved upmarket is what Acura needs to compete. Make the TL the entry-level sedan with a choice of engines (base car would be FWD 240 hp I-4 turbo from the RDX, top would be AWD with the 3.5L V-6). Next the RL should be a RWD and AWD 5/7 Series competitor (base engine the 3.5L V-6 and top engine a V-8). Finally, introduce a small RWD luxury-sports coupe/convertible (think M-B SLK or Lexus SC). Same engines as the Legend, but smaller and lighter."
4568,dino001,"December 19, 2011 7:57AM","If Audi can its sell Golf-based A3, so could Acura sell Civic-based RSX, RIP.  The problem is packaging and pricing.  There has to be enough separation between the vehicles.I think TL is a nice vehicle.  Don't really care for its nose styling, but that can be fixed.  Same with TSX.  The problem is at the top - RL is on verge of being irrelevant.   I have not seen one in months.However, their main problem is the line - it's just too short.  Their ""all inclusive"" approach is great for people looking for a good trade-up deal, but does not impress people with money looking to be awed.  No coupe, no convertible, no buzz-creating (albeit not necessarily profitable) supercar, no exciting supersedan - that's a big problem for an aspiring luxury manufacturer.  Too little choice - premium market likes choice.  People with money like to be different from others.  Even Lexus has long lines on different packages on their cars.I think biggest problem for Acura is Honda'a accountants - they probably don't give them enough to develop a real luxury lineup.  To understand why one has to look at Honda as a company, where automobiles are just a part of a much bigger structure, within which Acura is just a small line in corporate balance sheet."

4571,nyccarguy,"December 5, 2011 2:40PM","My thoughts on my 2010 TSX sort of echo some of your feelings toward your TL SH-AWD.  The engine/transmission combination is very smooth.  They feel perfectly matched together.  I don't oogle over the styling of my TSX like say a 335i w/ M Sport Package, but its design is handsome & far from boring.Could my TSX use more power via DI, FSI, Turbo, or Supercharging?  Yes, but then how much torque could the front wheels handle?  Would Acura's SH-AWD add too much as far as weight (& price) to its current entry level price tag without stealing sales from the base FWD TL?I'm happy with my TSX."

The dropped the low cost integra that got the youth in the door. They made the tsx bloated and its best car the TL (legend) is ugly and bloated.  They also killed the nsx which was a reason to go into the dealership in the first place.  Fwd setup not great for performance but it was these thigs that killed the brand and it's sales numbers. - Sh-awd or whatever it's called is pretty good setup but it's not the answer to get people in the door- they have more cara in th lineup then they did 10 years ago and sell half the number of cars."

All in you can't pick a car under the Acura nameplate that says look at me - ""I'm rediculously good looking"" - and that's a major problem.Love the traction this is finally getting - its time to release the TsX from this Elpps chat once and all as a lesson to Acura you can't stand around for 10 years and do nothing in an evolving car biz.

4576,markcincinnati,"December 6, 2011 11:21AM","Isn't the upcoming RSX supposed to come in at a lower price point?  Of course then there's the issue that the TSX is supposedly a cancelled product and that the TL will shrink in size.But if you can at least suggest that you can offer a lower entry point, price-wise, you may find you attract more and younger customers.  Truth be told the TL is actually much bigger feeling than my outgoing A4, which did, technically, have a longer wheel-base, but the TL is wider.Again, we seem to be in violent agreement, Acura needs an overall styling cue that is spread across all cars and, first and foremost, is attractive.You may or may not like the look of an Audi, but the entire line from the lowest cost A3 to the big buck A8L or R8 all have cues that they are Audi's.BMW, ditto.Acura is trying with their beak front end, but it obviously wasn't working for them, considering the plastic surgery the TL just underwent.C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points!"
4577,nyccarguy,"December 6, 2011 12:17PM",I don't know how much lower the price of an entry level Acura can go.  I think the average new car price is $30K.  The $30K price point is the new $20K price point of 15 years ago.

Yes I mentioned the Zdx 2 times- it seats 4, weights more then the mdx, ugly and has the sr engine as then mdx- also its overpriced .Acura is the new Buick. Buick is the new startup.

4579,sweendogy,"December 6, 2011 6:12PM","Yep - I think both last generation tl and tsx were good cars- they looked the part - didnt dare challenge, because Acura was smart and didn't include them in the conversation with real lux sports cars.

4586,dino001,"December 8, 2011 7:17AM","I still rather have NA straight 6.  Perhaps if (when) gas goes to 5-6 buck a gallon, I'll change my mind.I basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328, exactly because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 (got the wagon, so no 335i on that, plus 50K+ after some options still too much for me).  Boy, what a sweet machine - drove it in Germany on Autobahn, got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me.  Now waiting for delivery in Spartanburg - probably in January.Don't care about lower gas mileage, don't care about lower weight, higher power/torque.  I just wanted that NA straight six - it's probably one of the best engines in the history.  And I bet BMW would never have changed, if not for the new CAFE.I had enough four cylinder turbos - 2002 WRX and 2008 WRX STI, which are boxers, inherently better configurations that straight four.  Fast, great handling, in some aspects may better than 328 (allows faster corner entry and maintains that speed throughout).  Still - I just wanted more ""adult"" car than my STI, was ready to give up some power and even some handling.To me BMW 3-series was always about two things:  weight distribution (50/50) and straight six.  The 328 I just bought had interior that is just OK, but it looks like it was designed thirty minutes before the car was to be released - give some nice leather and wood inlays, add dashboard from 1989 and you're done.  The car overcomes that in those mechanical aspects, but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling.Audis are so much better looking(by a mile) both inside and out, have better equipment, cheaper.  Or being a little on frugal side, I may get even lower to TSX (not sure about that, but would give it a try) or even Volvo V50.To me BMW voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition.  They better make it up in other areas - or else."

4616,markcincinnati,"December 5, 2011 1:02PM","A friend of mine frequently uses the phrase: ""There's no replacement for displacement."" He is appalled at the number of cars that may offer more than 6 cylinders but rarely sell (or stock) anything other than ""blown"" I4's, I6's or V6's (both naturally aspirated and forced induction.)I tell him that there IS a replacement for displacement and that it is ""volumetric efficiency.""The 211HP 258 pound feet I4 in my 2009 A4 was both quick and fast -- with a 6spd automatic; in the new A4's the engine's rating remains but the car is even quicker, faster and more efficient due to an 8spd automatic.In favor of the V8 S4, Audi switched to a super-charged V6; in the S8 Audi has elected to drop 2 cylinders (from 10 to 8) and produce an engine that is both more efficient and more powerful -- considering its size the S8 is a sipper, not a guzzler.Only one Acura engine is boosted (the I4 in the RDX), and as far as I know there are no Infiniti engines that are either super or turbo charged.The V6 in my 2012 Acura is, frankly, pretty much a basic (but buttery smooth) fuel injected V6 of the modern era.  I was wondering what would happen if Acura (Honda) would change to FSI (fuel stratified injection) and super or turbo charge it?  Seems to me that with very little effort the engine used today if brought to the current state of the blown art, would put out at least 20% more HP and 10% more torque all the while showing perhaps another +2 MPG's.  Then, if they would upgrade the fine 6 speed auto to a current gen 8 speed, any Acura so blessed would go from its current potency (which is very good and is, at this time, Acura's most powerful engine [the 3.7, i.e.]) to high output potency -- in the engine department -- coupled with always being near or at the operating sweet spot due to the increase in the number of gears.Think if Infiniti, currently without any forced induction engine offerings, were to begin offering their engines with a super or turbo charger (and also keeping their 7 speed autos) -- makes my head spin.The Germans (and even the CTS-V) would have something more to worry about, with all these G's, M's, TL's and RL's armed for bear.Will Acura or Infiniti ever up their engine game to this level, or will they take down-tuned engines and alter their breathing and computer maps to get them slightly better than they are now with a touch more grunt in the 0-60 dept?  BTW, Infiniti already has a V8, so its creds don't need much engineering brain-power to at least be able to claim ""we have V8's"" even as they are bested by their very own 6's and 4's.I used to assume the car mfgrs read the engthusiasts magazines and the postings here on Edmunds and elsewhere.  But, apparentely they don't.  If they did and if they were swayed by what is said in both places, well you think they would pay attention and respond (even if only a little bit) to some of the legitmate critiques made by the authors.Audi and BMW are unlikely to loose credibility from a ""sporting intentioned"" family perspective.  If someone want's to be certain their car hails from a lineage that includes ""winners"" and a widely accepted high performance heritage, look no further.Acura, perhaps standing all alone, may be shooed from the ELLPS (a.k.a. Premium) board and ""chat room"" based on its historic but currently all but gone lack of focus.  Yet the perception that Acura is a bit fuzzy in the perception of premium department remains for them. The ZDX certainly didn't help and allowing the RL to, more or less, atrophy away hasn't helped either.  Of all of these car brands, Acura is in the most peril of losing its way.Infiniti and Lexus are mostly safe bets to perservere as players in the ELLPS and LPS field, from what I can tell (although Lexus seems much more the luxury choice than the performance choice, but they are doing a yeoman's job to make this perception go away somewhat.)Mercedes, too, a safe bet if what you really want is a bonafide member of the LPS club.Volvo is, for the most part, doing what I think Acrua should do -- and that is building a performance image to go hand-in-hand with their safety image.  They are about in the same position as Acura, the primary difference is Volvo seems to be really trying to put on a performance face these days.Finally the iconic American brand, Cadillac, has demonstrated, these past 3 - 5 years, a penchant for creating an image that may not quite be able to stand toe-to-toe with BMW or Mercedes, for example, but they do keep sneaking up on it with ever more interesting designs and power plants -- including volumetrically enhanced (super-charged) models like the CTS-V.We are in a time of inflection -- 2013 model cars are right around the corner and they continue to excite and delight (with the possible exception of Acura).So here I sit a guy with a history of 29 Audi's, 3 BMW's, 3 VW's and 1 Acura -- wondering why in the hell I got the Acura.  But, truth be told, the Acura is not a boring drive, quite the contrary in fact; however, it is somewhat boring to look at and, that more than anything, may be the crux of the matter.:confuse:"
4617,dino001,"November 24, 2011 6:12AM","You didn't undestand the actual comments:1. Putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company).  If car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, GAP (included in lease) will pick it up.  Other advantages are businesses don't need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer).  That's why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads.  Doesn't mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, it's generally bad idea, period.2. People who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease.  Lease is much more complex financing instrument with more variables that can be manipulated to createillusionof lower price. There are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturer's bank has to eat the price difference).One who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches.  All of that has to be factored in.  That's why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they can't afford the car (""don't deserve"").  It really is a simple rule of thumb - if you can't afford to buy it (loan/cash), you can't afford to lease it, either.   There are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doens't mean it's cheaper.I went through it with my recent purchase.  I got 328 wagon with a few options ($45K MSRP).  Correctly structured lease (0 down, 15K/yr) was about  $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total).  To me $200 per month is absolutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan.  I made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal.  Higher monthly payments, but better deal overall.  Now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but that's a different discussion."
4618,flightnurse,"November 24, 2011 6:34AM","Thank you setting the record straight, there is also another factor that goes into leasing, is someone credit score, if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days, it wont happen.

It may indicate that they either don't understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment.  I don't think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"".   It's kind of like the old saying that people that can't afford to buy the car will lease it.   Kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female.They could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these cars.  Making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending!Complete understanding of the leasing process and concern about all the possible risks involved indicates one is more knowlegeable.....not better off."
4621,dino001,"November 24, 2011 4:48PM","I looked back at your post.  At fist glance G37 looks better than 328  even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments.  I looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10K/yr (so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage, not on the road). However,  Infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41K MSRP less $2.7K due is $38.3K, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4K, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer.  BMW deal is structured around MSRP, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from.  If you take out that 2 grand Infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar.  In other words you walk into BMW and you can get your price down by a bit, but at Infiniti it's probably close to bottom line.Add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things).  I think it's a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but G37 being faster and perhaps better equipped)."
4622,dino001,"November 24, 2011 7:32PM","Fat chance on those $40.  There is no doubt BMW can get expensive at times.  I don't kow prices at Infininti dealers, but all other lux cars (incl. Lexus or Benz) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so I find it unlikely Infiniti would charge much less.  $40 are those mineral oil changes at Chevy, Ford or Toyota, not synthetic.  A six pack of synthetic Mobil 1 is almost $40 at Costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car.  To balance, BMW has oil changes every 10-15K miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3K miles changes.BTW, Infiniti has lease return fees.  Directly from Infiniti website ""Disposition Fee due at termination of lease"".   All lease companies do, no exceptions.  They may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand.I get  it- you like Infiniti.  Fine, there is a lot to like.  Just don't oversell it.  It is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe.  Still 40 grand."
4623,dino001,"November 24, 2011 8:18PM","I clicked and I was right.  This is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on BMW.  So it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison.  This also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.Again, G37 is a good car  All I'm saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe.  And I know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs.  All I'm doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks.  Manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage.  Doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say.Again:1. Infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500.  Lower BMW price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.2. Both have disposal fee.3. BMW pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance.  Infiniti does not.  Just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period.  Add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.4. Infiniti has better features and power.  BMW has better resale.  If you want comparable BMW, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.Altogether BMW may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much.  In my town BMW dealers are far superior to Infiniti in customer service and sale experience."

If people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point what's the sense in trying to have a discussion.Service prices have nothing to do with whether one car is better than another and I don't think that was the jist of this conversation anyway.  Someone was just trying to point out the lease cost differences.....not whether one car is better or not."

We currently have a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium and a 2012 Acura SH-AWD Advance.The Acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and speeds, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 Audi S4 Premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the torque vectoring option called Sport Differential.)Many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (that's me) -- whenever I utter or type those words.  But damnit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, I'm a software guy not a professional car reviewer.But there it is -- a $47,000+ Acura TL drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 Audi S4 (if they are equipped similarly the Audi's price shoots up, big time.)  A serious Automobile magazine comparison of the two cars may not convice you that the Acura should be shopped against the Audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both cars) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the Acura and the Audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.look here:http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.htmlIn any case, I was driving a 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with Audi Drive Select for Pete's sake -- and I wanted a new 2012 Audi.  A reasonably well equipped A4 (not S4) could be had for about $47,000, so the Acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.Problem was, the Audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the Acura's lease point for 36 months.Bzzz.  A 4-cyc Audi w/211 HP (and it seemed smaller than the Acura) vs an Acura w/305 HP with every possible do dad that Acura throws on these cars?Even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous Audis could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).In any case, given an identical deal, I probably would have re-upped for the Audi (at the time, in fact, I am certain I would have); but the dollar done me in.  Hell, at the time, for the exact same money, I probably would have gone for a Volvo S60 T6 AWD with a few option boxes ticked off.Now, 5,000 miles later -- I am, I admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great power and power delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.The Acura TL SH-AWD Advance may not quite know what it wants to be, but for the time being it is the bargain of the bunch for performance and content methinks.Still loving the Germans, but temporarily on vacation with the Japanese.-- MarkOh yea, drive it like you live.:shades:"

4639,markcincinnati,"November 29, 2011 11:56AM","I would assume Audi and BMW (and Merc, Infiniti and Lexus, too) will continue to offer V8's -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great engines.My point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a V8 is now a 6"" (either I6 or V6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super-charger.  Likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.These changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller CI engines (with forced induction) to improve the car's efficiency (without sacrificing performance.)Acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7L and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the HP and torque needed for a flagship vehicle.When I was in Germany I noted the D class cars all over the place, but mostly with smaller engines (an A8 with a V6? yep.)Maybe Acura will pull the covers off of a new ""Honda"" V8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better said, WANT to invest in a complete re-do of the RL.)At this point, I care not -- and I have no idea if I will get another Acura.I really like the TL in SH-AWD Advance trim -- but a lesser TL didn't do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen Audi (B or C class) will draw me back.  In other words, I was passionate about Audi's, but I am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the TL is concerned.The hell of it is, the Acura TL SH-AWD advance is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh Ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car.  Add to that ""everybody"" says Acura's are both reliable AND durable (especially when compared with Audi's, eh?)""Everybody"" says so, anyway.But this claim, at least, is left to be seen.  At 5,000 miles the Acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the engine is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 Audi's and my wife's last BMW (a 2008 X3 with all the toys on it.)I would tell you my Audi's were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. I have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, I assume Audi's are simply not as durable as some other cars, once the miles climb well above 50K.So, will Acura survive and THRIVE as an LPS or ELLPS without a V8?  Beats the heck outta me -- customer's memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a V8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery smooth, powerful and quiet engine that responds to the touch of the accelerator. Any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder engines.Acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current ""Advance"" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image.  Currently, the image, if you asked me, is ""We're the Bucky Beaver Brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the ZDX and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""The current TL is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the technology offered.Hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.In any case, I'm sticking with the ""who cares about offering a V8?"" theme for them.Drive it like you live.:shades:"

The only Infiniti that I could get that had BSI was the M and I had to order an M with BOTH Premium and Technology packages to get the BSI (and the tech package seemed to contain expensive automatic cruise control hardware and software that I did not see -- at this time anyway -- the value in.)  I also shopped for a new A6, but the lease rates and the discounts offered were breathtaking (and not in a good way)!So, I test drove the G37X with EVERYTHING on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic.  Yet, the G could not be had with BSI -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track.  The G has a track of 60.2"" and the TL is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the TL feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 A4.)I probably would have gone with the G, despite the above, had it offered BSI.Another contender was the Volvo T6 which could be had with BSI and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.As someone said, to each his/her own -- the G just seemed cramped inside and somehow, compared to what I was used to, made me feel like I was a bug when I took it out on the Interstate (full of semi's).Drive it like you live.  :shades:"

4649,markcincinnati,"November 8, 2011 1:19PM","You may be right about your longevity concern -- I really don't know.  What I have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.Perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- I would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter MOTOR?In any case, I assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.Somewhere I read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started COLD; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more MPG's, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. It is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of cars and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)Fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell I watch too much TV) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of cars, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)Mostly (which is NOT the same as entirely) I am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). When a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, I am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward.  :surprise:"
4650,shipo,"November 8, 2011 1:43PM","Regarding the whole Start/Stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, I don't think it will affect engine longevity at all.  Why?  Because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.Other fuel economy related thoughts:I find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if I might be so bold, highly questionable.  From my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle.  I'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power assist pumps, the A/C compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).Remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain.  The only company which has announced such a research project is BMW; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later."

On the other hand, I have some SACD's that sound like junk even though they're 24/192. The Police ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" sounds terrible.Most of the time, I can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a Redbook CD and SACD even when listening carefully with headphones. In a car?!?! Forget about it.The best thing about the Acura sound system is the surround sound. That's definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others.Mark, do you have any Porcupine Tree DVD-A's? You must get some - they will blow you away!Trying to remember who told me, but from a reliable source.......the ELS sound system in the TL-Tech is made by Pioneer.  Why they don't brand it, I really don't know.  It might be Acura's choice.  I know for awhile, Acura was using car systems by Clarion, but the current ones that come with the tech packages (not sure about the source for their standard stereos) are from Pioneer.Long and short of it, I think Acura used to use Bose, and advertised that they did (requirement from Bose, perhaps?).  But, that was several years ago.  Since then, they never advertise who makes their car stereos (same for Honda).It's still the best car sound system I've ever listened to.  That includes the HK system in my 335i (which is no slouch) and the B&O systems I heard in the Audis I test drove.BTW...agreed on Porcupine Tree.  Also see if you can find the DVD-A disk from Dishwalla called Opaline.  Don't get the ""dual disk"" one, but the DVD-A version.YES-Fragile is probably the best DVD-A I've ever heard.Too bad that format never really took hold.  Also too bad my HK system in the BMW doesn't play DVD-A disks, either.I find the HK system in the BMW to sound better streaming from my iPhone than it does when Sirious or HD RADIO is the source."

It would be a shame to scratch something irreplaceable.I don't think I can trace the blame for any scratches on a disk to any of my car stereo's over the years.One of the benefits of SACD and DVD-A was supposed to be that it was either scratch resistant or almost immune to sensitivity from minor scratches.  They are supposed to be quite durable.So far, I have none that cause any skipping issues, but then again, I have not seen any DVD-A or SACD systems sold for vehicles yet (other than factory Acura system).Are these disks really irreplaceable?

4703,markcincinnati,"October 25, 2011 10:28AM","I have found that LPS and ELLPS car dealer salesreps virtually never go along for the test drive -- assuming the car you show up with at the dealership is already in the same class or that the car is at least fairly new and you don't look like something the cat dragged in.If you show up at the dealership with your significant other, too, I can bump that up to ""the salesrep NEVER goes along for the ride.""  Now, one thing they do, if you are a stranger to the dealership, is photocopy your driver's license.On the other hand, if you go into a Ford dealership (not picking on Ford), to drive a new Taurus, they ALWAYS go on the ride with you, ditto with Honda, Mazda and VW, to name a few.Since it has never happened -- the salesrep ride along -- with this class of car, I usually take a long test drive (about 1 CD's worth) and then almost immediately go onto the next car I am considering and repeat the same test drive (over the same roads, route, etc.) also for about 1 CD (the same CD, natch.)My wife and I have a routine for testing that permits about three (maybe four) cars to be tested back to back to back (to back) in one day (Saturday or Sunday if possible.)  This most recent time we used the video capture feature of an iPhone 4G and she recorded my reactions while I drove and I recorded hers, etc -- as we drove each car over the exact same route, speeds, etc, etc. Afterwards we compared our instantaneous reactions as first I drove an Audi, then a Cadillac then an Acura (ditto her.)Frankly, and I know many here will argue that I must have been on something, we drove an Audi S4 Premium Plus, a CTS-4 Sport Luxury (with 19"" sport package) and an Acura TL SH-AWD Advance back to back to back: we found the S4 and the TL to be twin sons of different mothers they were so close in their capabilities (and the TL was the clear price winner.)  The CTS4 was ""very nice"" but seemed to lack the weapons grade torque the other two seemed to have (and I admit the S4 had more, but the difference was not worth the extra premium price, especially considering the fact that the S4 didn't even have nav.)Our test drives include: acceleration runs (to 80+MPH), parking lot (empty) ""slalom runs"" (to test understeer -- be aware this causes motion sickness if you have just eaten), panic braking (with ESP on and off), freeway driving (20+ miles, one way, or so, at least) and secondary road (where there is very low traffic) ""performance"" driving.We listen to the radio (AM, FM and Sat) and the CD. We test for bluetooth pairing with a Blackberry (difficult to do for many cars) and we see how intuitive the voice command/prompt systems are, etc.If you take along some popcorn, you can make a really entertaining day of it -- and come to some rather unanticipated conclusions, too.  Take me, for instance -- I thought for certain I would end up with Audi #30 or an Infiniti M37X.  Acura wasn't really on my radar.  I thought I would end up with a Volvo S60 T6 before I would ever go for a ""butt ugly"" Acura.DOH!  :surprise:"

Maybe driving into the Audi dealer with a Honda made them treat me like a VW customer.Do they ever impose mileage restrictions on you?  I'd imagine if someone said be back before closing and that gave me 5 hours driving time, you could drive 300 miles easily averaging 60 MPH.  I'm thinking 150 miles would be a sufficient test drive.  In San Diego, that would be like a drive to Julian and back; which would be perfect to test all of the capabilities properly.I don't necessarily need to be alone, but I think 100 or so miles are needed to make a purchase decision on something over $30K."

Yet manufacturers, like Acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. If I were the manufacturer, I would seriously consider dropping something THAT unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)Likewise, other good deeds don't go unpunished -- my 2009 Audi A4 with the 19"" sport package came with Max Performance Dunlops -- SUMMER only tires.  My dealer claims they never stocked the A4 with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year 'round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc.  So, no mo' UPH or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. And, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesn't come with A/S shoes.The list of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin' -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.Those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first pony up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. Case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an Audi A4, I first had to agree to buy the A4 configured as a Prestige model.  No 19"" wheels for the proletariat.Acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless I went with the Advance designation; now that I have the Advance, I am glad, since I also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated AND cooled) seats along with the BSW system.Of course every manufacturer here in ELLPS land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications.  Hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.I'd like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their cars to be built; I'd also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices.  Why is it that I couldn't get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but I could get crystal black with umber? Who's dumbass rule is that anyway?The list of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to amaze.  I guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these cars are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- TAKE THE CUSTOMER's MONEY for pity's sake!Why are back-up sensors NOT a factory option on an Acura TL?  My dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since I had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).The dealer didn't make any money on THAT transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a FACTORY installed option.Where was I? What time is it? Oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put RS-A's on the top o' the line TL?Drive it like YOU live!:surprise:"

4722,graphicguy,"October 17, 2011 5:44AM","mark....billy....I have a dealer who I buy my Acura products from (if I'm in the market for an Acura).  Any year, any color combo, any equipment level, any model.   If they have to find one for me, they will.   The deal is a skinny one.Then again, I've bought 3 Acuras from the same dealership, same sales person.  It's really simple dealing with them and I always get a good deal.Same way with BMWs.  I go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (who's been there for 24 years).  If they don't have what I want, they'll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with BMWs, it seems).  Again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle.  And, I've also bought multiple BMWs from them.I've never been able to deal with either the local Infiniti dealer, nor the local Audi dealer.  Neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.However, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the Infiniti dealers and the Audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.Go figure.Mark...you know the dealerships (Audi Connection, Infiniti of Cincinnati) I'm talking about.  I don't even bother shopping the local Audi dealership anymore when I'm in the market.  They don't have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer).  Then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble.The Infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesn't seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (Audi and Infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal).  Maybe their focus is on leasing.  But, I'm a purchase customer, not a lease customer.That diamond white paint on the TL is super expensive.  I had to have body work done on my diamond white TL and the shop that did the work said it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right.  Hand it to Acura to pull off such a feat on a production car.  It is stunning looking, however.billy...I liked that umber interior.  I almost bought one with that color.  My Acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those cars with that interior color, they were hard to sell.  So, I figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.Mine had ""stone"" interior, which I liked quite a bit, too."

Geez, silly me; I'm thinking a 328i (or better yet the 2.0 liter turbo F30 model which is slated to be the 328i replacement) is pretty much the perfect BMW for me.  Why?  Given that my 2002 530i SP 5-Speed was so close to absolutely perfect for my needs, wants, and desires, and given that the E90 and the F30 are almost spot on in every metric, but with a bit more leg room, a tad more power and slightly less weight, the ""Bad"" 3-Series couldn't be more ""Gooder"" for me (unless we&#146;re blessed with something like a 6-Speed manual 325d on this side of the pond)."

4731,markcincinnati,"October 21, 2011 6:23AM","This thread is more than a tad interesting since I, for one and apparently MORE than one, seem to find some surprise that the TSX and a 3 series BMW (even though it is the ""bad"" one) merit cross-shopping.The TL SH-AWD seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an AWD BMW 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an Acura and a BMW.But, of the choices offered up in this thread, I would find the Audi 2.0T quattro with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the Volvo S60 T6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping.  Then I look at my recent purchase of a TL, after 29 Audis in a row, and knowing what I cross shopped, well maybe I see the rationale of shopping for both a BMW 3 X-drive and a TL SH-AWD (but never a TSX.)Having had three AWD BMW's since 1988 (in addition to the 29 Audi's), there is no comparison between the BMW and the TSX in terms of the ""feel-behind-the-wheel"" -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.Although not comparable to the BMW in terms of the ""ultimate driving experience"" the TL SH-AWD does a better imitation of an Audi A4 2.0T quattro Prestige than any other Japanese car I test drove. In fact the TL SH-AWD Advance (which adds 19"" wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 Audi S4 Premium+.Given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the TSX is only comparable to the BMW in that they both have four wheels -- the BMW is THAT much better.:confuse:"
4732,m6user,"October 21, 2011 9:05AM","People purchase cars for different reasons and just because they want a somewhat sporty sedan they may not NEED or even want the greatest ""feel behind the wheel"".  They may be shopping price and size as the most important factors on their heiracrchy of needs.  The TSX is a lot more similar in size/weight to the 3 than the TL is.  They may want good winter traction but not neccesarily the best.  While front wheel drive isn't quite as good as all wheel drive is pretty adequate especially if you use snow tires in the winter.  Stepping up to the TL SH-AWD is also quite a jump in price from the TX.  About 10K or so and about 3K more than the 3ix.  The TL SH-AWD is also about 500 lbs heavier than the TSX.  The TL is 16"" longer than the BMW....that is a lot.  While it may not drive that much heavier it is still a much larger car and many people just don't want that much metal to manuever around.I like the G37 but would get it in ""X"" form because of winter traction.  If I bought a TL, the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price.  Don't really care about the extra HP or being able to take hairpins at speed.  Your car buying criteria may be different than others looking at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that.  So it is not wrong to cross shop the TSX with the BMW 3, it is completely right for many people.By the way, I enjoyed your suggestions for improvement over on the 2012 TL thread.

Well the A4 is 4cyl, fwd and about exactly the same price in base form and and is almost exactly the same size but actually weighs more than the TSX.  Who is bloated?  Just because you can get it in quattro means little.  For the same price you can get the TSX w/ a V6(not all that great IMO but doable) and blow the doors off the A4.So I guess if the TSX has to go so should the A4."

You can't give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy.

4740,markcincinnati,"October 7, 2011 7:15AM","The Audi Connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the European (at least the German) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait.  No instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""let's go buy a new car. . .TODAY!"" and we're off to the races.We leave our houses late on a Saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a Chinese restaurant for some take out.Sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at Lowes.The Germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)I was lucky that the AC had a basically stripped S4 in stock a few months ago (an '11).  It didn't even have nav (at THAT price). It had the DSG tranny and it had, apparently, HUGE urge.  It felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the A4 (non sport) or the TL, although at full cry the TL's 3.7L motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the A4 2.0T).  The great thing about the Audi's is that they use FSI and are either Super or Turbo charged.  Imagine for 30 seconds what the TL 3.7 SH-AWD would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5L now enjoys.Acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""TL/S"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (Brembo's with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in.  Perhaps it could move the AWD bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/S"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only Acura aficionados would appreciate.) I'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the Advance 19"" wheel, only different.Perhaps this would add too much to the MSRP and the Acura Advantage (VALUE) would, for many, vanish and they would get the SLine A4 or the S4 or the Volvo S60 R Design, or even the Bimmer.I would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented TL.  After all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- Lexus for pity's sake, LEXUS!Sir your High Performance La-Z-Boy is ready.  Never thought THAT would happen!C'mon Acura -- you've clearly got some great engines (thinking of Indy cars, for example) in your DNA, let 'em out.  Let My people go.:surprise:"

Many magazine writers do opine that Infiniti's G37 and G37X are Japanese Bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the G in the #2 spot.Well, hell, try to equip the comparable BMW 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the G above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the BMW's MSRP under $50,000.""Again, I am not suggesting that the BMW is #2 in this contest -- I am simply suggesting that a G equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the Bimmer would probably show the Infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.But if you're looking for VALUE, the Infiniti must be at the top of the list.A G37 (X or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7L motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a comfortable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.For the price, the Bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, I said ""for the price.""Additionally, the G's have very very attractive lease programs -- often better than BMW's attractive programs.:shades:"

More content and by some definition, I'm sure, more car for the money when you're comparing Infiniti to BMW (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); I think I'll compare Acura to Audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.The G37XS was a car I wanted to like -- but I was smitten with the M37X which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige goes for or what a BMW 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for.  The G37XS after coming from an Audi A4 (2009 vintage) seemed ""cramped"" -- too narrow and with, apparently, no expanse of hood to speak of.Yet, the G was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of power, albeit with a little harshness as the RPM's moved toward red-line (neither the Audi or BMW engine seem harsh.) Had the car been at least 2"" WIDER, I might have gone Infiniti rather than Acura.  I certainly feel Infiniti, as a brand, has the LPS ""vision"" (whatever the hell THAT means) whereas neither Lexus nor Acura seem to have much of a clue.But, I got behind the wheel of the TL Advance and it WAS wider, I could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 3.7L at full cry is quite pleasing.  Too bad the TL isn't quite as quick feeling as the G -- but man, the TL has the G in smoothness -- the TL is like butta!I am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the looks of the TL (exterior), I am pleased with the interior -- the seats are almost Audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, I am almost embarrassed to say.)The TL is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ELLPS (but ONLY in Advance trim or Tech trim with a 6 speed, based on reviews -- and ONLY if it is SH-AWD equipped.) Here's a 1,500 mile review:Smooth and quiet: checkFeels bigger than it is: checkIs, technially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, checkBest factory sound system ever: checkVery quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): checkThick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty"" seats: check, checkFeature set is at least as good as the other ELLPS's: checkTorque Vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: checkDecent Gas Mileage (combined 26 according to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): checkAnd the list of positive attributes could go on and on.I do like driving the TL -- very much -- I don't regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (Lindsay Acura, Columbus, Oh.)However, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts.  Audi and BMW (and I'll assume Mercedes) somehow seem to imbue their cars with ""something"" that makes them feel like MORE than the sum of their parts.It's not that the TL seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does.  But there is something that is lacking -- something that a new A4 Prestige Sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instantly. In some ways, for the price, the TL outdoes (content wise) both Audi and BMW by a wide margin.

And, I thought that $600 was a reasonable price for the upgrade...especially one developed and warranted by BMW.For all intents and purposes, my 335i just became a 335is.Plus, I think that BMW has under rated both the N55 power numbers that they publish officially.

I think it's (a lot) smaller than the TSX and doesn't have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. I do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.The TSX weighs less than any version of the A4 Audi makes. It's also lighter than the G25 and IS250. And Honda's I-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors V-6 motors.The TSX is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. The switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below Audi but certainly as good as or better than Infiniti, Lexus, and BMW.Plus, if you do own a 2004 6MT TSX, then you know the joy of revving that Honda I-4 up to 7400 RPM - only BMW's legendary I-6 is as satisfying to wind up.And talk about keeping pace - the TSX has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and Infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more HP and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! Acura must be doing something right to inspire Infiniti and Lexus to build such close competitors.Every car in this segment has an Achilles heel. The TSX is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ELLPS for the money. But if you want more than 200HP, then obviously it's not the right choice."

4765,sweendogy,"October 2, 2011 8:43AM","i never said that- but I did say the TSX should be moved from this group- it has not ""advanced"" with the rest of the group and in comparison tests it gets beat by ""lesser"" cars - in 2003 it was a player but that was 9 years ago."

It is eclipsed in HP by several cars in this segment, but it soldiered on. Why? Because it sells.It is the entry point into BMW luxury and prestige. For Acura, the TSX is the entry point into the ELLPS segment. And it sells - warts and all."
4768,nyccarguy,"October 2, 2011 12:52PM","There are so many cars out there that aren't fantastic at one thing, they don't look good on paper, but they are great cars to drive.  My TSX is one car that falls into that category.  It's 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race.  You really have to drive a TSX & a V6 Accord back to back.  They ""are not"" the same car.You seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various Internet site.  It's like some people who say ""why do I need to spend $XX,XXX more for an M3 (or S4) when I can just chip my 335i (or A4 2.0T) for $X,XXX and get just as much or even more power?"".There's also a company out there that makes a bolt-on supercharger for a V6 Mustang.  It makes the V6 good for 475 horsepower.  If you were in the market for a Mustang, would you buy a 5.0 GT or a V6 and get it supercharged?  I'll take the V8.I'll agree with you and fedlawman that the TSX V6 is a nose heavy pig.  I personally don't think it needs to be in the Acura lineup.  A V6 TSX has a sticker damn near a FWD TL & Honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the V6 TSX to sell it.  I have the sane gripes with C&D regarding itselectric power steering.  The original TSX was a smashing success for Acura.  I think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units.  How many did they sell that 1st year?You have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market.  I believe the 2 main gripes  (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modestpower output.  They made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a V6 option (whic doesn't sell well & adds weight & torque steer)Anything the ""tuner crowd"" says Acura should use from it's parts bin will ruin the car's driving characteristics & appeal.  ""Give it SH AWD"" adds weight, cost, & complexity.  ""Give it the 4cyl Turbo from the RDX"" adds cost, complexity, & weight.  Not to mention torque steer as well.Part of the TSX's charm & appeal in this ELLPS segment is it's price point which it gets from being built on an Accord platform (or being an Accord from the rest of the world), it's 201 horsepower 4 cyl engine, 5 speed automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8 speed auto, that'll cost you too), low weight, the fact that Acura evenOFFERSa slick shifting 6-Speed manual transmission.Try walking on to your local BMW, Audi, MB, Lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,C,A4,IS have MSRPs under $40,000.  Yes I know you can order your car any way you like it.  Acura gets you into the door of this segment.Like fedlawman said, drive it against an IS250 & G25 to tell me it isn't competitive and doesn't belong.  Ive never driven a G25, but have driven an IS250 AWD (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & it's 201 horsepower V6 accelerates about as fast as a Toyota Yaris.  The TSX's base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to it's 7,000 RPM redline.  I can tell you it has a certain Germanic ride quality to it.  Very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph."
4769,m6user,"October 2, 2011 1:31PM","acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acuraJust what percent of BMWs, A4s, C300s, Gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies?  I'm pretty sure it's very close to the percentage you attribute to ""non-sports"" cars.  Just because they are offered doesn't mean that they sell that many.  I think I read somewhere that even BMW is only about 10% sticks.  I don't think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor  as you keep saying over and over and over again.  I also know some pretty darn good car drivers that don't drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they can't drive well.As far as the TSX goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority.   Edmunds, when comparing to the GTI, said it wasn't as good a sport car or something like that.  But, they did put it in the same category."
4770,m6user,"October 2, 2011 2:04PM","A better question would be why do you have such a vendetta against it?  Acura, as a brand, may have gone astray of some their sportier past models but that doesn't change the TSX that much at least any more than other brands have grown and gotten heavier.    Acura is a luxury or a near luxury brand.  TSX is it's entry level offering and it's a sedan.  The only questionable operative word  in the title of this thread then would be performance which is somewhat subjective.  So for you to set the bar is quite assuming it seems."
4771,sweendogy,"October 2, 2011 2:15PM",well the board is to talk about Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans which I feel and have shown by reviews and sales figures that it does not belong here in its current state.

4772,sweendogy,"October 2, 2011 2:48PM",ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the TSX grouped in with lesser cars? your right that is silly
4773,smarty666,"October 2, 2011 4:58PM","There really is no subcategories of this class, such as premium, performance, etc. This category is made up of all the entry-level luxury offerings of the luxury manufacturers which are the vehicles edmunds has listed here, they just titled the thread wrong.

Service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good.  [Lufthansa A340-600.]We met Rolf [ retired BMW employee ] at the designated spot and he drove us [ in his BMW Diesel Wagon ] first to the local BMW dealer in Munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in Austria and in Switzerland, then delivered us to the Welt.  Just in time to watch the 11AM &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show.  Interesting.  Rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from Boston ] while he drove and talked.We filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a list of potentially useful information &#150; most of which I had seen before on various forums.  He was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions.  The reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something I had to keep reminding myself about all trip long.  And I was cautioned again that Switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their speed limits &#150; period.  Noted.We had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;Premier Lounge&#148;.  Very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & overlooking the vehicle delivery area.We had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car.  The customer service rep. pointed out various features [ this is my first BMW ] and set various preferences [ KM vs. Miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ]Actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their café, for the afternoon drive.They certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience.  We could have also done a factory tour and \ or the BMW museum, but I had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule.I had rented a GPS \ Navigation system with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of Munich and onto the A8 heading south and east.  Worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well.  Here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc.  once on the Autobahn, I was quite well behaved, speed-wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all.My daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the A8 and headed straight south on A12 \ E45 \ E60 toward the Austrian border.The navigation system routed us differently than I had expected, and I did not realize it immediately.  It also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the B&B in Krimml.  A lovely B&B within sight of the Falls.  Had a very good dinner in their restaurant &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed.= = =Day 2 &#150; Saturday 17 Sept. &#150; Krimml to Verona, ItalyThere had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast.  [ pictures ] We had breakfast at about 9 and headed toward the Falls.  We actually drove past the Falls and up to a couple of overlooks [ start of the Gerlos Pass \ Alpine Road &#150; pictures ] and then drove back down to park and hike in.  The sun came out brilliantly as we started the trek.The hike up to various views of the Falls was fairly steep, but the scenery was quite spectacular.  [ pictures ]After we finished the hike, we stopped at their café for coffee and an apple strudel.  Excellent!  We stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance.Then we were off &#150; heading up to the Gerlos Pass.  The sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views.  Just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic vista &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above.  [ pictures ]Descending, there was just no where that I could pull over \ off the road to safely stop.  And the road demanded attention.  The views were often stunning &#150; and the road was in excellent shape [ as were most roads we encountered in Austria ] and I just needed to pay attention.  My daughter really enjoyed the views!Heading back north toward the A12 \ E60 we encountered some sort of festival [ in Stumm or Fugen? ] that involved cows with elaborate &#145;headdresses&#146;.  Unique in my experience.And we stopped at a McDonalds for a quick bite of lunch.  Odd to see their take on menu, etc.  And my daughter bought something [ delicious ] from a trailer parked in the lot next door.We hit the highway, toward Innsbruck, turned south and crossed into Italy.  This is where we encountered the first real issue of the trip.  I had not done sufficient research to realize that the area from before Trento to Verona was as industrialized as it was.  My bad.  I had expected to be able to simply [ ? ] pick an exit off the highway and find a hotel or B&B to stay for the night.  This turned out to be a very bad idea.  Long [ and winding = narrow switchbacks, in the dark ] story short: We finally asked a toll-taker at an exit in Verona for a recommendation at about 9PM, and stayed at a hotel just off the highway.  Very basic, small rooms, but adequate & inexpensive.= = =Day 3 &#150; Sunday 18 Sept. &#150; Verona to La SpeziaWe had a surprisingly good breakfast at the hotel and then headed south, toward La Spezia.  This drive was relatively uneventful, until it started to rain.  The highway was well worn [ tire ruts ] in spots and even with brand new Michelins, there were times when I felt it prudent to slow somewhat.  And the GPS \ nav again became confused &#150; taking us on a more circuitous route [ even narrower and more winding ] than necessary from La Spezia to Pitelli.  Really, really narrow streets.  Cars parked on either side.  Raining.  Not confident of the Nav system&#146;s routing &#150; somewhat stressful.  But we did arrive &#150; and not too late =  4:30 or so in the afternoon.After settling in, we asked about a place to have dinner.  A few mis-communications and assumptions and much walking later [ and rather wet ] we managed to have pizza at the only place in the village that was actually open at about 6 or 7 on a Sunday evening.It rained, often quite hard, and was quite windy until 3 or 4 AM.

We find virtually every part of Europe worth a return visit is the point.

4779,sweendogy,"October 3, 2011 5:32PM","Ray good recap . Always wanted to know what the process and experience with this program- it was a good break from the TSX bashing/ lovefest of the past week, and after reading this it also clarifies what lux and sport should be for me.  It must be cool being able to explore the limits, something you can't do on the LIE."
4780,markcincinnati,"October 4, 2011 7:29AM","No, it takes one day to install the back-up sensors.  I live in Cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where I also purchased the sensors from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in Columbus.100 miles separate these cities.I travel EVERY Saturday to Columbus.  The arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following Saturday.  This, for better or worse, gives me the use of the TSX for about a week.I am able to note the Acura upgrades to what is essentially a Honda of some kind (people here say it is an Accord).  The fit and finish and the interior are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a Honda.But, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the TSX doesn't, to me, represent an entry into the ELLPS crowd.  But, as I said, live and let live, keep it in and we'll see what happens.I would think that the TSX would be ""naturally"" cross-shopped with an Audi A3 -- for instance.But, as I said, I cross shopped a 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance with an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige Tiptronic and, for fun, I drove a Premium Plus S4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the Sport Differential (Torque Vectoring). Also, I shopped the Acura against a CTS/4 Luxury Edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a Volvo S60 T6 and against an Infiniti G37X/Sand an M37X Premium+Tech. Having just come from a 2008 BMW (my wife's), I did not look at a 3 series, my German preferences satisfied with the A4 and/or S4.To me, these cross shopping adventures seem MOSTLY rational (the M37X is an outlier) -- I would not have considered a TSX anymore than I would have considered an A3, for instance.I drove my 2009 A4 Prestige with the 19"" sport package to work, yesterday --  today I drove the TSX in. I would say the differences were like Filet Mignon vs Laura's Lean hamburger patties.  I like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.I did test drive both of the Audis and the Acura on the same Saturday in June -- I also test-drove the CTS I mentioned.  The Acura was, best I can describe, like an Audi AS4 quattro if such a model actually existed.Anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up sensors are not taking this long, the issue is where I live vs where I bought.  Once the sensors are in, I will either use a Cincinnati Acura dealer for service or I will take advantage of Lindsay Acura's Saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc."

I'm going to somewhat agree with Sweendogy and say that my TSX is a ""Sporty Sedan"" instead of an all out ""Sports Sedan.""Considering some of the cars its being considered to by some posters here (no disrespect to anybody in particular), might not be entirely fair.  A fully loaded up almost $50,000 A4 with Quattro, Sports Suspension, and Torque Vectoring Rear Differential.  I would hope the Audi drives a whole helluva lot better.  Same thing with a TL-SH AWD.The TSX V6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base TL to buy a TSX V6 with a similar MSRP (even though the V6 TSX is loaded with incentives most of the time).Where does the TSX go from here?  You can't give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy.  You can't give it Acura's SH-AWD because that will add weight and price.The TSX is a great car.  I own one and love it.  It has a taut suspension, adequate acceleration, fantastically supportive seats.  It it fun to drive, gets good gas mileage...I'm happy with the decision I made to buy it.  I've got over 41,000 miles on it after only 25 months.  In a little less than 3 years it will be paid off and I'll hopefully be able to drive it relatively trouble free for well past the 100,000 mile mark.If there was never a cash for clunkers program, we drove our leased X3 for the entire 3 years and it had 60K miles instead of 45K for 3 years, would I have even set foot into an Acura dealership?  Probably not.  If something happened to my TSX today, would I get another one?  I'm not so sure."

4790,markcincinnati,"September 27, 2011 1:50PM","I am pretty well convinced that my 2012 TL will outperform my 2009 A4 2.0T, too.  The Audi, which has Audi Drive Select, can be put into ""dynamic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. It has 19"" wheels with Ultra High Performance Yoko S.Advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).It has rear wheel drive biased quattro and last but not least has 211HP and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.It, the Audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.The TL isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase.  It is nose heavier than the Audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not Ultra High Performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased AWD, but also includes torque vectoring.  It feels a bit softer than the A4, it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305HP and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.The Audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the Acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305HP allows the Acura to always show the Audi its tail lights.My Audi, all in, was $49K (MSRP) The Acura, just south of $48K -- at these prices power rules.  And, overall the Acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seats (that the Audi lacks).Said it before, irrational as it might be, if the Audi were the same lease price per month as the Acura (that is about $200 less), I would have gone with another Audi -- just for that special something that only a German car seems to offer.Irrational.Couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. I am overall quite pleased with the Acura and if they continue to improve and move forward AND keep their value prop, well, I could become a TRUE BELIEVER.You know, though, any of these cars are pretty damn nice.:surprise:"
4791,nyccarguy,"September 28, 2011 12:28PM","graphicguy & markincincinati - I think the 2 major things you'll both notice that are different between your current & former TL SH AWD & current BMW & Audi are:Steering.  Having never driven a TL SH AWD, just my 2010 TSX, I can tell you the electric power steering stinks.  Road feel is non-existant at low speeds.  At higher speeds it is really nice and tight though.Brakes.  There is a reason that my TSX is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment.  Acurahondahad to cut corners somewhere.  The brakes on my TSX are terrible.  Nothing at all like BMW'sRIGHT NOWbrakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.Obviously power is different too.  Mark's Acura is definitely faster than his former A4, while graphicguy's 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal cars on the road"
4792,sweendogy,"September 28, 2011 5:02PM","Breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura tsx less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the accord platform. Its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the TL, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in  sh-awd form) Closest to the germans is Infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) .  Cars from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with MPG mandates - I know BMW will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, Acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with MB for its next line of engines, should be interesting."

4795,graphicguy,"September 29, 2011 7:16AM","nyc.....interesting compare and contrast.  My BMW does indeed drive better than my TL SH AWD.  That said, the TL was no slouch.  Neither were the TSX and RSX I had as loaners.  Acura captures a good amount of the BMW feel.Also, little things I've noticed....the HVAC in my TL was better in getting to, and holding temps, hot or cold, with no ""fried feet"" or ""frozen nose"" affect.My 335i is fast....very fast....and will let me corner at any speed that my nerves will allow.Seats were better in the TL.  If you care, the stereo in the TL was a big step up vs the one in my 3 (which is actually the upgraded Harmon Kardon stereo).  I've driven a lot of premium cars.  The stereo in the TL tech package surpasses all of them, by a pretty fair margin.Transmission (autos)....hands down better in the 3....which has one of the best I've ever experienced.Build quality, the BMW gets the nod.  As good as Acura is (and Acura is very, very good), BMW is better with gaps, paint, etc.Reliability, hard to say, this is my 3rd BMW and I never had any issues with any of them.  But, I've had 3 Acuras, too.  Never had any issues with any of them, either.I know me, though.  3 years down the road, I'll be looking for something else.However, given what I'm hearing that 4 cyl (even with turbos) will be the calling card for BMW, I'd probably look elsewhere.I'm fearful powerful 6es, with turbos, gobs of torque everywhere, may not be in BMW's radar in a few years.  Hope that's not the case, though.The motor in my 335i is one of the sweetest I've ever driven, as was the 3.7L in the TL."
4796,markcincinnati,"September 29, 2011 12:46PM",". . .I can tell you that the Acura is not an Audi (DOH!) but as mine is equipped (2012 TL SH-AWD Advance Package), it is a capable car.  Believable as an EL Luxury Performance Sedan -- totally believable.  It would be more believeable if Acura had chosen the best available Ultra High Performance A/S shoes instead of the ""OK"" Goodyear RS-A's.  My 2009 Audi A4 was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19"" 35 series Max Performance Dunlops, Sport Seats and 3 Spoke Sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension.  I also configured mine with a $3,000 option called Audi Drive Select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed Dynamic mode.I was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011 A4 Premium Plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or Audi Drive Select.A new A4, even in Prestige dress (but without the sport package option or SLine and Audi Drive Select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new TL.  A new A4 minus the sport package lacks the bolstered seats (which the TL has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the A4 in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll.  Meanwhile the TL grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the torque vectoring makes the car damn near PIVOT through the corner.The TL is not an A4 and it is, duh, also not an S4.  However when talking about these cars' abilities in the twisties, the TL behaves more like an A4 with the SLine or Sport Package and pulls hard enough to ""allow you to imagine"" IMAGINE you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an S4 way south.  In other words, the TL is caught somewhere between an A4 2.0T Prestige with the Sport Package and Audi Drive Select and an S4 Prestige with the sport differential.Given a magic wand, I would have the S4 Prestige with ADS+Sport Diff -- in a hearbeat.But, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the S4 commands) tends to change one's mind.This time, even the A4 2.0T Prestige w/Sport priced me out of the Audi market -- especially AFTER I had driven the TL Advance back to back with a 2011 A4 (which, admittedly did NOT have the sport package.)That it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ Audi A4 SLine (mine lacked SLine trim bits) to subjectively feel as performance oriented as the TL Advance, says SOMETHING about Acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), I'm not exactly sure what that something is.The next gen TL is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow pony up the coin for another Audi.  :surprise:"
4797,nyccarguy,"September 29, 2011 7:54PM","markincincinnati & graphicguyFunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to cars.The seats in my TSX is one thing that I absolutely LOVE!  They are thickly bolstered, firm, & super comfortable.  They do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive handling maneuvers.The main thing that fueled the purchase of my TSX was fuel economy.  Back in August 2009 I had a 1990 BMW 325i I bought about a year earlier that wouldn't pass NY state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me I should either find a new engine or start paying him to tear the car's Inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong.Cash 4 Clunkers came about and I realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate.  I was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 X3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles.So I wanted a car that drove great, had a roomy back seat (for our 2 child safety seats), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).I headed straight to an Audi dealer to drive an A4 Avant.  I drove a Premium model & thought it was OK, nothing special.  I was also frightened at the prospect of owning an Audi for the long haul.I went an drove a Mini Cooper S Clubman which I didn't like.  A very awkward car.  Lots of blindspots.  Lifeless and very disconnected electric power steering.  Rubbery shifter.  Clutch with a high take up point.I then stopped by an Acura dealer, drove the TSX & said to myself, I really like this car.  It drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 Prelude Type SH.  It is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks.I've got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early December.  Cars are expensive (especially the ones I like).  Right now I do too much driving (TSX is 2 years old & has over 40K, while Pilot is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease.  Leasing is also very expensive.  Nor can I afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.I plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our Children's college educations.I've owned exclusively new cars since I got my license at 16 (besides my E30 BMW which was a project car).  I love the way BMWs drive so much that if something happens to my Acura, I'd look for a CPO BMW 335 with the N55 in a heartbeat."
4798,fedlawman,"September 30, 2011 5:23AM","NYC,Graphicguy makes some good points. I'm about 10 years ahead of you too...My daughter will get her learner's permit next year and I've already started teaching her how to drive a stick on the weekends (yes, in the M3!). The family dynamic will change permanently when she starts driving.We got the V70 with 3rd row almost 8 years ago and it's been a great family hauler, but when my daughter starts driving, we have some choices to make. Keep the wagon and give it to her?Also, my wife hates the M3 - refuses to drive it except as a last resort. I've started thinking that it's selfish of me to keep it around if I'm the only one who is ever going to drive it. Plus, I have a company car for work, so I only drive the M on weekends or when the sun's out and I get a hankering. It sits in the garage with a trickle charger for most of the winter.So we could keep the Volvo and sell the M3. Let my daughter use the Volvo and get a 911 or 135i or something for me and my wife to share.We could sell the Volvo and the M3 and get a 135i plus a Subaru Outback.We could keep both the Volvo and the M3 and get a 3rd car like a Focus or Cruze for my daughter.Whatever we decide, there are definitely some confusing issues with the changing family dynamic and the car market. Cars are crazy expensive now and like you (and others here), the cars I like are expensive. I would rather not spend $50k on a car, but nothing I have looked at that I like costs less than $40k.I was a new car buyer for many years too, but since I started driving BMW's (my E30 325i was my first one 7 years ago), I can't help thinking there's no value in it. I might try a CPO car next to add some value to the process.Whatever we decide, trading and buying a new car every 3 years is definitely out. I love the fact that the Volvo is paid for and 8 years old, and my wife stills loves the car. The Volvo experience has taught me to buy the most car I can afford and keep it as long as possible."
4799,flightnurse,"September 30, 2011 7:25AM","Interesting, having driven a couple of S4 myself and a new TL-SH AWD I thought the S4 was by far the better car, the Audi did not lean as much as the TL in corners and I thought the Quattro system was set up for more rear wheel bias then the Acrua.

However the looks of the Acrua even after a mid refresh to me is just ugly, its hard to beat the Audis in looks and overall design."

4803,markcincinnati,"October 1, 2011 12:18PM","Short answer, no.  At this point, an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine with everything on it except ADS would be a great car.  I have ADS, I have, currently both a 2009 A4 Prestige + Sport Pakage (that has ADS) and a 2012 Acura TL Advance.In 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + Sport or SLine packages, I see less of a need for the $3,000 ADS option due to the fact that the new A4's can be had with an 8-speed tiptronic that comes with Sport Shift and in Sport Package or SLine configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport seats and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.In other words, TODAY, I would not get an A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine, w/ 8 speed tiptronic and pony up for the ADS.Another reason I would not get this option today: on the A4, Torque Vectoring is not an option (yet).  I would pay for the ADS -- on an A4 -- if it came with TV.The S4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47K TL Advance -- but the S4 can be had with TV, under the name Sport Differential. I believe to get TV, however, one needs to buy ADS (on the S4.)  The total additional cost to get both ADS+Sport Differential is, as I recall, about $4,500.The S4 I would want would have to be contented to the TL Advance level, and that requires that the S4 be configured NOT as a Premium Plus, but as a Prestige model.If you do all of this to an S4, its MSRP is some $12,000 more than the Acura TL Advance with backup sensors (which is how I have mine configured.)Now, having said all of this, I would rather have the S4 than the TL.  Moreover, I would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige+SLine without ADS, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the Acura lease (the MSRP's would have been very close to each other so configured.)I should stipulate, that to save a bit, I would be fine with the A4 2.0T Prestige 8-speed tiptronic version with EITHER sport package or SLine, and I know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than SLine, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other performance inducing differences.In any case, my decision was not based on which car I thought was the best -- I went with the one (THIS TIME) that I thought was the BEST VALUE.  The TL Advance (with the oddly optional back up sensors @ $725) filled that bill very nicely.  My lease on the TL for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the Audi A4 (Prestige, Sport, etc, etc) for 42 months.  At 36 months (apples to apples) the Audi was about $200 per month more than the TL which, although it ain't no Audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.I've had 29 Audis, since 1977.  I have been to the Ingolstadt factory for the how they build 'em tour, 6 times.  I have participated in 4 Audi driving schools in Seefeld, Austria (and won one of them -- fastest time through the course.) I, for a number of years, would bleed little interconnected rings when cut. Audi of America sent me to St. Moritz along with 49 other of their ""top 50"" North American customers for the Audi sponsored women's downhill ski cup event.And, I bought one of the first A8's in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after Audi sent my dealership a Euro-spec A8 and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new A8 -- which I did.)If the above doesn't qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an Acura TL Advance and an Audi A4 or S4, I don't know what else does.If I could somehow have been convinced that the Audi was not just incrementally better than the Acura, but substantially better, I would have probably gone with the 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige SLine w/8-speed tip.  But after driving two Audis, an A4 and an S4 (2011's and the A4 did not have the sport package -- or SLine, and the S4 was what is simply called Premium Plus and it did NOT have the Sport Differential) then driving a Cadillac CTS/4 with the 19"" wheel sport package (2011) and then the Acura TL Advance, I thought the Acura TL was most like an S4 than it was an A4 or a CTS.I also drove a Volvo S60 T6, an Infiniti G37X/S and an Infiniti M37X Premium+Tech, and an Acurca ZDX Tech. While my '09 A4 was in for service I also had been loaned a 2011 Audi A6 3.0T Premium Plus for a day.Every one of these cars were test driven (and I was video'd by my wife whilst I was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound systems were tested with the exact same CD's/tunes (Wecome to the Machine, Pink Floyd; How Dare You, 10CC; and, New Frontier, Donald Fagen.)So, I offer up for your consideration: the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, Infiniti and Volvo are all great cars and more alike than different, generally speaking. I wouldn't kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and I'd even bring the crackers.You can argue that the Audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the Acura the ugliest (well, hell, that's true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the Cadillac is the ""blingy-est"" (no doubt) and the Infiniti's remain the Japanese BMW's, while the Volvo is the most unexpected -- and delightful to drive -- car of the bunch.The Acura does excel in one area: it has the best damn factory sound system I have ever heard.And, for me, an almost S4 at the price of an Acura TL Advance SH-AWD, is a no-brainer.Drive it like you live -- I'll say it again, these are all very nice cars and all deserve your consideration if you are in the $40 - $50K market.I am, for the next two days driving a new Acura TSX which is the loaner car I was given while my TL has the back up sensors grafted to the rear bumper -- it too is a ""nice car,"" but compared to the others in this Edmunds category, it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.That's my story and I'm stickin' to it."

4805,tlong,"October 1, 2011 4:09PM","I have owned both Audi and Acura. I tend to agree that for a big price, the Audi is generally a nicer car. But your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, IMHO.""Cars developed for the autobahn"" - All of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. Some Accords in fact are developed in the USA. Germans develop cars in the US, GM develops cars in Europe and China and Australia. It's quite simplistic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.""comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque"" - seems to me that BMW and MB have plenty of 4 cyl engines in Europe (on the autobahn) and somehow that's ok.""The Acura TSX has a narrow price elasticity"" - frankly, I don't see why price elasticity has ANYTHING to do with being a sports sedan, as if tacking on $10K to a price makes a non sports-sedan into one.Ultimately, a sports sedan shouldn't be about cachet, or where it was developed, or whether it is fwd or rwd or 4wd, or whether there is an autobahn or potholes nearby, or whether the platform is shared with economy cars, or whether the price is high or low or elastic or inelastic. What matters is how the car handles, how it feels, how well appointed it is. Given those criteria, Acuras are pretty close to a lot of the European offerings."

Please get me a recent article where and acura product (NON SUV) has beat anyone (not named buick) in a comparison test.

And the fact that the current acura sales demographic is closer to Buick then BMW. Now i agree that a true sports sedan has prob died due to current weight of the group we speak of.Now for you to disagree with me is fine but what about the edmunds article that declared the jetta gli better then your tsx ? And you are right your tsx could stay with a 325 but the current tsx could not stay with the current 328 and I think that's my point, current Acura models just can't compete because they never evolve."

Quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury.The main reason Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in Japan, they don't really exist.  There is Honda.  Period.  There is Nissan.  End of choices. Toyota just recently stsrted selling Lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of Toyota.Mercedes, they make luxury cars and that's it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line.  It's not a standard vehicle that's been tweaked and had a lot of bling added.  It's the real deal.  BMW is the same.  And Audi, though they are a lot like VW in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering.  A lot like say, Cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but it's always been its own company/line.Acura does nothing for me.  In fact, Volvo makes better cars these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most people's radar here)  Infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but it's also huge and basically like a big Lexus in how it drives.

I do agree with your comments about Lexus though being a ""safe vanilla choice"". Mercedes Benz is another ""safe vanilla choice"" and neither Lexus nor MB has ever done anything to knock my socks off.  They both are devoid of soul and fun.But Infiniti is no way a safe vanilla choice by any stretch of the imagination. That just goes to show you really need to test drive the vehicles you put down.

What's amazing is that we consider an Accord with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here.  Now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit jaded over there, but you'd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the U.S.  Not re-badged Accords and Buicks and the like.Perhaps we've been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic.  The TSX might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware.  To consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts.  Front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the V6, dead steering feel, and, well, the list goes on and on.  If you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you.As for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more.  They now all make large luxury cars with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.Here's a challenge:Find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. If 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat.  No, the 911 does not qualify, obviously.It must be rear wheel drive.It must be under 3000lbs.It must be sporty.  Not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.And that's before we add the luxury requirement to the mix.Can anyone here find one?  Really.  Maybe I forgot some vehicle or something?  Everything I find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier.   Even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category.

We want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of AWD, we want our cars to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19's, 20's or even bigger (and heavier) ones.  We want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated seats even. Hell I don't want these things, I NEED them!  Doesn't everybody?I suppose ABS and ESP and Brake Assist weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and I certainly want the OTHER drivers to have these features, since THEY --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)So we're ""stuck"" with ever heavier cars -- because we WANT them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.Frankly, virtually any of the following: Acura TL Advance, Audi A4 Prestige/Sport (or S-Line), BMW 335i xdrive, Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Performance/Luxury, Infiniti G37X/S or Volvo S60 T6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 Audis in a row I bought a TL was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car I wanted, a 2011 Audi A4 Prestige/Sport.  That and the 19"" wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305HP engine.  Oh yea, and an even better sound system than the B&O system found in the Audi (and THAT is saying something.)I may find, as some suggest here, that the Acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the seats).  Residual values suggest otherwise, but I don't even have 1,000 miles on the Acura yet, so I am not a reliable or experienced witness.Anyway, kwitcherbitchin', the cars are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.):surprise:"
4822,shipo,"September 22, 2011 8:32AM","Like it or don't, if you want a car with in excess of 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, you'll also need to buy a car with a heavier engine and drive-train.  Throw just the engine from the 335i into a 328i (a process which will bump the weight in and of itself), and just watch what happens to the rest of the drive-train.  Not pretty.As has been stated here before, between the regulated in safety features and the market demand for larger and more powerful cars, it is physically impossible to build a relatively inexpensive sedan with the size, safety and performance of a 335i for anywhere near 3,200 pounds."

When your lease is up and your BMW is still exactly the same, are you going to lease another BMW or try something different.Forget the fact that you are an enthusiast (we are a drop in the bucket).

The comparable Acura and BMW always wins out over them.Where did you buy yours.....Superior or Columbia?"
4828,markcincinnati,"September 23, 2011 8:13AM","Thanks for the congrats -- here is the Buying Story.I found a website called CARWOO.COM -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity.  Unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, CARWOO takes money ONLY from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.)  I paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to EVERY Audi, Acura, Infiniti and Volovo dealer in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.  I limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from Cincinnati.CarWoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.You then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the CarWoo email machine to start sending you links to your CarWoo account with offers from dealers.To make a long story a bit shorter, Volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off MSRP discount.  Bzzz! Thanks for playing, maybe next time.Infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.Audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any A4 would have to be ordered.  One of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000 A4 for pity's sake).Acura, locally, came in AT BEST, with a 6.5% discount off MSRP (Columbia).  A Columbus Ohio dealer -- Lindsay Acura -- came in at 13% off MSRP for a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) Here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from Columbia -- I have the window sticker! Whatsupwiththat?!?The car was $499 per month + tax.I had driven ALL of the cars (not a Lexus or MB of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the A4 (what's not to like I still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the M37X and the TL SH-AWD (Advance model).  Likewise I thought the Volvo S60 T6 was GREAT FUN! I also had a chance to drive a Premium+ Audi S4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.)  Now THAT car was the most fun of all (but in Premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other cars I had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)Truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, I drove the Audi, the Cadillac and the Acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.I am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND"" posts, but I will venture to say this -- the Acura TL SH-AWDAdvanceis very close in performance and overall ""character"" to an Audi S4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.Now the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance is no Audi S4, I am not saying it is, the S4 would be the winner, but contented to match the Acura was just shy of $12,000 more and I could not muster the one that I drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners THAT much quicker than I could the Acura (which may have had an advantage over the Audi at the time since the Acura had torque vectoring and the the Audi did not.  Moreover, the Audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the Acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the Audi.So, I says to myself, the Acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you CarWoo.Com.No one else even came close.Remember I was pricing an A4 2.0T Prestige 8-spd Tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close MSRP wise to the Acura.  The Cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not focussed on performance as much as the other guys.  And, the Cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 CTS does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. All the other guys do -- and I consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required.  How much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50?  What were they thinking?  And, moreover, Cadillac in the 4-door CTS does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the Audi and the Acura at the trim levels I spec'd.So, thus far, I am missing the Audi new car smell, I miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but I rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, I miss the Audi needle sweep when I start the Acura up.Then, I get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305HP 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, I'm at 80MPH in a distance that seems not much longer than my driveway.Loving the cooled seats and the best sound system I have ever heard in any car (including the B&O in Audi which had been my previous fave.)Having said all of this -- I probably still would have gone with the Audi 2.0T Prestige Sport if it had come in at a price to match the Acura.Money talks, as the saying goes. . .  :surprise:"

I've driven both.  The N54 had a bit of turbo lag (not much).  But, BMW overboosts it at higher RPM (which is why the 335is is rated with more HP and torque than the N55.  However, I think both motors are under rated and put out more HP and torque than BMW says they do.That said, I'm trying to decide if I want the extra HP/torque.  That would essentially make my 335i coupe with the same engine performance as the 335is, which is mighty good.But, mine is really good to begin with. I'm debating but probably will do it when I can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done.  Who doesn't like more HP and torque? :shades:How's your new Z4, BTW?  Did you ever post pics?"

Not a single problem at all in the first year that they've owned it.And even if something does go wrong, it's a lot less than a Mercedes to fix.Lastly, yes, I know the Japanese companies play around with names and so on, but the comments are all too true.  The G37 does share enough DNA with the Z that it's just not possible to hide the fact that it's a modified Nissan Z.  And The IS, while it's not *exactly* based upon a Corolla, it's small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it.  Kind of how a Buick is well, a Buick, even if they come in different sizes."

They both handle and drive completely different...Just because the Lexus IS is slightly bigger then a Corolla doesn't mean its the same car, again one is FWD the other is RWD, one has a 4 cyl and the other is a 6 cyl..."
4842,smarty666,"September 15, 2011 3:54PM","I think you better get off your rocker and go out and drive the cars your talking about because it just sounds like crazy talk. A G37 drives and rides completely different from Z, not to mention the fact it has two extra doors on it, duh, and a Corolla completely different from an IS. Just because a luxury company has a parent company does not make their stuff crap.We go by that logic then Cadillac's are glorified Buick's as they both share platforms. Because a car shares some components with another does not make it look or behave like one."
4843,alltorque,"September 16, 2011 3:01AM",".............Based on that logic, the Austin A40 my parents had when I was a kid, and the Ferrari Daytona are similar because they share the same designer. And of course, the current range of Bentleys are just glorified VWs.Therefore, SEATs and Skodas are cheaper, but better built, VWs.  Audis are dearer VWs and Lamborghini, Bugatti and Porsche are merely faster VWs.  Jaguar and Land Rover are merely upmarket TATAs and Ferrari and Maserati are very quick, and expensive, Fiats.  Rolls Royce ?  Upscale BMWs.  Vauxhall/Opel/Holden ? Rebodied GM-parts bin cars.Once you get past the SEAT, Skoda and Audi brands, (which basically are re-worked VWs), the logic falls apart pretty rapidly; although there are some component commonalities in amongst the others and their brand-owners mainstream offerings.  Way of the world and none the worse for it.By the way, I learned to drive in an Austin A40.  Nice little motor, for its day."

They are simply not anything like the original sport sedans which BMW and Volvo made in the early 70s that created the whole segment.It has gotten so bad that BMW was essentially forced to make the 1 series to remain competitive.   The 1 series is at least pretty close to the E36, which is barely passable.  A bit heavy, but workable with some weight reduction tricks and some aftermarket tweaks.   I put the specs for the older E30, though, because it's really the benchmark for this class.  Which every manufacturer seems to have simply ignored in the race to have more and more power. (same as the ""Big 3"" did in the 70s with Muscle cars).Heavier than a Buick.

4851,markcincinnati,"September 19, 2011 1:40PM","I wonder why you test drove the Acura TSX but not the Acura TL.  I am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the TL probably compares ""better"" to an Audi A4, BMW 3, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G (etc, etc).  After having owned 29 Audis, I sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an Acura TL ""advance"" AWD, an Audi A4 Prestige with sport package, an Infiniti (also with several packages including Sport AWD), and a Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to make it comparable to the Audi/Acura Prestige/Advance packages. I was planning to make my decision based on the best deal I could get on any one of these.Although I did look at a TSX, it seemed a step down from the others I mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an Audi A3 or perhaps an Infiniti G25 or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational cars.A point is that, to me, all of the cars in this class were contenders and I drove all of them (excluding the MB, why I can't recall). Three of the cars stood out as high performers (four, actually, but I'll get to that in a moment): the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, the Audi A4 Prestige with Sport package and 8-spd Tiptronic and the Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the Audi and the Acura.  The fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the G37X S -- a car I wanted to want, since I am so impressed with my wife's 2011 FX35/Premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).The G didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest.  I later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems cramped from behind the wheel.  The TL, for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the G's 60.2"" track.I made my decision, after 29 Audis in a row, based on price per month.  I was ready to take (and I wanted) an Audi A4 first, the TL second and the Volvo third. I test drove the heck out of the cars (and I currently have a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige Sport) and determined that the Audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.)  Yet, both the Acura and the Volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the Audi, which was a plus since I often have my in-laws in the back seat.When all was said and done, the Audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the Acura and the Volvo was about the same as the Audi but for 36 months to the Audi's 42.I took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the Advance package it is, MSRP wise, about the same as the Audi, but has a 305HP engine, although it lacks the Audis 8 speed transmission.Having tested and previously having owned an Audi S4, I came away thinking the Acura TL SH-AWD (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an S4 than it is to an A4, and for $11,500 less with similar content.Sorry for the long story, but I think you should have at least tested the TL, it is a completely different car than the TSX, and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an A4 or G37, etc. The TL, on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the A4 and G37 (and the CTS for that matter.)In any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these cars are winners.  :surprise:"

Add some more modern rubber and a few tweaks like beefier calipers and so on and it's pretty nice.What we have now is symptomatic of the bloat-until-it-assumes-the-previous-one-size-larger-model's-place progression that seems to infect all of the makers now.  This is also identical to what was happening in the 70s.  Bigger and bigger and oh my word that's a huge car all of a sudden...The 1 series is kind of like a E26 V 2.0 in its weight and size.  It's what I would consider a sports sedan, if a bit on the heavy side.But what we have now as the current crop of cars are really big bloated grocery hauling machines that just are called ""sporty"" because they are the smallest whales in the pod and happen to have shiny rims and big wheels attached.That said, the TSX simply doesn't belong as it's just a plain vanilla ""Accord"" to the rest of the world.  Over here, they slap Acura badges on it and raise the price.  It's front wheel drive, has a plain vanilla 4 cylinder engine, and the handling is, well, standard family car.

Now, the Honda *is* a great engine, but it lacks that polished sound and feel that you'd get in, say, a Porsche or other high end car.  It's exactly like thinking that your American made Fender Stratocaster is a great guitar (which it is) and then getting your hands on a true custom guitar.  The goalposts simply moved without you realizing it, and now you're a bit ruined in your expectations.For the price, especially with year-end rebates, the C is becoming a very good deal.The other car that impresses me is the CTS.  Reliability is excellent as far as I can tell, aside from the yahoos who break their CTS-V models' engines and rear diffs and then blame it on the manufacturer.

Since this is my first foray into luxury I really didn't want to find myself regretting my choice in cars.  I set out to look at the TSX, IS250, 328i, A4, & G37.  After reading some things I added the C300 to the list, which you'll hear about.  I am looking for people's input into  my decision as I'm still unsure and I'd like to hear how you've liked the brand you chose and its cost to own.  I'm scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car.  And I'd rather not ""feel the road"" which sounds redundant owning a small car but if I can feel every bump then I may as well buy another corolla and deal with the potholes in Jersey.I was most hopeful going in about the IS from Lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current corolla from 2005.  I hit my head on the roof while driving (I'm only 6ft tall) and i'm a big guy but the cabin felt cramped.  Every time I talked to the salesman he acted like I was making a mistake not buying a bigger car.  Do no salesman just listen to what you're saying about preference?  That car is now off the list and will remain there.I drove the G37 and thought it was a very nice car.  It felt ""classy"" inside and, I guess sterile is the word that comes to mind.  I actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group.  I hate the idea that driving a small car means you can't drive more than 2 adults around.  It was about $35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors.  I didn't like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that won't totally sway my decision.  I think it drove ok although not as well as the Audi, BMW or the MB.  Additionally my mechanic loves these cars and says they are the most reliable.  I'm a bit unsure still though because I don't want Nissan parts in my luxury car.  Its still on the list.  If I can't justify the extra $5k or so then I'll end up in G37 if I had to guess."
4877,jerseyguy77,"September 11, 2011 6:22PM","I drove the 328i next which was always at the top of my list.  I figure it can't be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right?  I'll start by saying I wasn't happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others I'd tried up to this point.  What I mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the AWD which is supposed to make the BMW great.  I figured that they would try to make that equal.  I also was a little taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who I dealt with.  They were basically like, the other people's cars could never do this, and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the car's handling.  I'm pretty sure that the A4 and MB (just to start) could do that type of driving if I wanted it to...I mean they're both cut from a similar cloth.  Otherwise I did like the car.  I thought the navigation system looked like it wasn't made to be in the car.  It did feel much more like a sports car than the others I had driven.  Since I drove it on a ""test track"" I will be going to a different dealer so that I can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels.  The car has significantly more options and colors than the others in this category which I appreciate because i don't want a white/red/grey/black car.  I want a nice color blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue.  Its kind of ridiculous.  Also assuming that all else is equal I do think the ""extended warranty"" offered by BMW is huge.  I would love to not have to pay $50+ for every oil change.  Even if i am paying that a bit upfront...The last car I drove, which I may drive again, is the C300.  I didn't have this on my list at all as I had heard terrible things about MB over the last few years in regards to reliability and design.  I wanted to try the car however as most who I know who've tried it mentioned that it was much better at ""hiding"" the bumps in the road which is a big deal in North jersey.  As I mentioned in my first post if I wanted to feel every bump in the road I would just buy another Toyota.  In the smaller car segment you feel everything in most cars (which I hate) even though I will only drive a small car.  I thought the car was very nice.  As nice as the Audi in my experience and I thought there was a very ""expensive"" feel to the drive.  I didn't significantly notice the ""cloud"" feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results.  They are adding a blue color in 12 that I want to see because that may put this ahead.  Again though the cost may be prohibitive....we'll see.I'd really love anyone's input into what decisions you made and why on these models.  I will probably be making a decision over the next month or so."

In previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter rubber, but that's where the advantage ends. The additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. Of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. That's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterHere's a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4sSo you should forget AWD and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead.  If you live where you really get bad snow, that is."
4881,kdshapiro,"June 13, 2011 5:42AM",I have plenty of snow experience. The awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.I don't want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. But in the northeast there are a lot of cars on the road with awd.It easy to sit in LA and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. Why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains?
4882,plekto,"June 13, 2011 7:38AM","Yet, you don't hear about people in Europe having problems with RWD Mercedes and BMWs being dangerous in the winter, do you?  Winter tires are considered a normal thing in Germany and everyone uses them.It's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be.  The way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an AWD system.Proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use.    That video, btw, that I linked to was of a RWD BMW.Oh, and we do get snow in California.  I didn't always live in So. Cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state.  And in all of that time, I never once considered what type of drive (FWD/RWD/4WD) the vehicle had when I purchased it.  I adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation."
4883,plekto,"June 13, 2011 1:44PM","Well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with AWD.Does it actually work?  Most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. If the system transfers power back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly.  Most manufacturers get this horribly wrong.The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distribution. (0/100 under default conditions).  It's basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from videos of the system in action that I have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's AI to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)Too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head.  There are numerous articles and videos out there about half-baked AWD systems, so I'll not go into this further.The other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages.  Is it worth it?  Probably not.  It's certainly not full-time AWD like Audi and Subaru use."
4884,tlong,"June 13, 2011 8:49PM","Don't forget that AWD doesn't do anything for braking. It can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all cars brake on all four wheels."

Awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.10 years  I probably would have been preaching being a purist. Now I just want to enjoy my ride and I don't care if I'm getting the last ounce of performance from it. Or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. I just don't want to get stuck.As an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions."

4893,2233,"August 25, 2011 7:41AM","The run flat tires are a deal breaker for me.  I recently drove the 328xi and the X3.  Both were very nice.Most posters say the run flats are loud, expensive, and do not handle as well as non run flats.  Most dealerships and tire stores do not stock run flats.  If you get a flat tire, you can drive it 100 or so miles but it then must be replaced, not repaired.  If you are several hundred miles from home, especially on a weekend, you will be stranded for up to 3 days waiting for the expensive tire to arrive at the dealer or tire store.  You can change the tires to non run flats, but the storing of a spare could be problematic since no space is alloted for a spare.I would rate the G37 first of the ones you mentioned.  Great handling, good looking, and very reliable.  The TL would be the last vehicle I'd buy.  I've owned 2 Acuras but never again.  The C class is nice but reliabilty problems are a concern."

On the expressway, I get 23 mpg.We have a 04 G35X and a 07 G35X.  The exhaust on the 2004 is definitely loud but I hardly notice the exhaust on the newer 2007.  I notice the exhaust more now that I replaced the tires with Michelins on the 04.  There is a clear difference in the newer Gs re the exhaust sound.  You may not even notice the exhaust on the new Gs.I will probably buy an EX35 soon.  I want something small with folding seats.  Some consider this a G37 with a little more storage.  The EX is something to consider even though it is technically not a sedan but the smallest crossover on the market.  Infiniti has some nice incentives now."

4897,2233,"August 25, 2011 6:35PM","The abilities and liabilities of the tires are pretty important to most.There is no room for a spare in the X3 if you switch out the tires to non run flats.The interior of the current 3 series is very dated but the X3 interior is a huge improvement.There are many posters on the BMW sites that do not care for the run flats, although some do like the fact that they generally won't have to change a flat tire.  Getting stranded if you are out of state is a big concern in addition to the noise and poorer handling.That being said, I love the handling of the current 3 series.

In fact, few other than BMW use only run flats.  Porsche had them years ago on the 959.This site has arguments both ways for the run flats but the majority of these owners are against the use of themhttp://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/06/run-flat-tires-.htmlI considered taking the run flats off a new X3 if I purchased one but there is no convenient place for the spare except taking up space in the smallish space behind the rear seat.They are loud, do not handle as well in the opinion of many, cost almost double, do not last as long and if is difficult to find them in stock.Car makers should make the run flats optional.I like the G37 of all the fine cars mentioned here.  It's probably the least expensive,  has the great VQ engine, is good looking, handles well, is reliable, and is rear wheel drive (or all wheel drive).  The ride of the TL is a different type of ride which I do not like.  I've owned several Acuras but will never even consider these again due to their ongoing transmission issues.My second choice would be a current 3 series but I would ditch the run flats as soon as they wear out.....probably around 15,000.

If they wanted more HP, then take the turbo engine from the RDX and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 HP range. This would give the TSX more HP without having some of the FWD turbo issues. Add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.Being back in school for my masters, I needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so I went with a 2010 Ford Fusion SE with 6 spd manual and the Appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with.  I got 235/40/HR18 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24K OTD. It has a bigger back seat then the TSX and living here in Phoenix, the last thing I want in the summer time is leather.But I'll be looking for a new 2012 A4 once I'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the TSX, BMW or C class."

4910,fedlawman,"June 10, 2011 9:31AM","The ""growl"" of the engine in the G37 is different than the resonance from the tailpipe. It's the VQ's unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think it's going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 RPM.BMW's inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding, smoothest revving engines on the planet, and it's well worth the premium in price to have it."
4911,sweendogy,"June 10, 2011 12:06PM","unrefined i laugh at that- the engine has been a work horse for nissan for years-has won engine of the year multiple times over (in prev variations) - it throws out 330 hp and gets ok fuel economy. Its not a bmw engine no,  but its not unrefined -- drive a base dodge charger and you'll worry about ""throw a rod"" as you try to get on a local on ramp.  Infiniti might be louder then BMW but again its different - i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle- we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points, the power, the sporty nature and quality.i own a infiniti g35x from 2007, actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form."

However, the 2012 has smoothed out lines and a lot better looking grill.  It's probably right in between the G and the ES as far as ride/handling goes and gets 20city/29hwy with the new 6spd auto trans on the front wheel drive version which IMO is pretty good for a roomy luxury car."

If you didn't like the price they offered you then DON'T SELL IT TO THEM. Having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your Infiniti's, if you had them in excellent condition.

It's definitely not a proper luxury sedan, though.But for the price, it is also a good deal - at the end of the year, with incentives, we're talking about 3-4K more than an Accord V6 or Camry V6, and about the same price as a TSX.  As an upscale family sedan, it is a fantastic alternative.***As for the original poster's comments, yes, it took me a long time to get over the whole Mercedes stigma as well when I first owned one years ago.  They are fine cars and if it's any consolation to you, they carry a bit less stigma now than a typical BMW does.  At least around here.The C 300 Luxury is probably the best compromise, though, since the sport is nice and all, but the interior of the Luxury is by far better.  Just two things, though - one, you absolutely do want to add the rear spoiler to it as it makes the back end look more defined.  And the panoramic sunroof is awesome looking with the Sandstone Beige. (it's tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast)  It's really the only color combo that the car looks best in, IMO, and I generally hate beige and tan colors.  35K all over town, so CPO at 25-30K is a snap."

That is what I made the decision on when I was choosing between the two."
4928,plekto,"January 12, 2011 5:55PM","It is worth noting as well that the CTS is almost as good as a BMW 5 series in hard driving.(that said, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car)   That base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary.  The interior as well is almost identical to an Acura or Audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is.  It feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the G37 does that as well, I have to admit).  The panoramic sunroof is awesome.  And in a first for GM, the NAV system actually works.My only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the Civic, there are *zero* visual cues).   But it's not alone in that, either.  The worst offender currently is actually the new Honda Crosstour, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility.  It also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a Cadillac to have a hood ornament.   It's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.Me, I don't parallel park if I can help it, so it's not an issue.  Just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and cars direct say there are still some 2010 CTS models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32K if you don't mind black. (27.5K for a base model(29 with auto), 30K for the Luxury, 32K for the Performance, and 34K for the 3.6)   Almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.But.. even a base model CTS for ~29K... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20K range drop off of my radar.

I think the TSX I4 with tech is a much better option at the same price point plus your getting a nav system in that vehicle. The mpg of the G25 is not really that great considering it is only 1mpg better in city/highway miles compared to a RWD G37. It should be a lot better than 1mpg considering the difference in engines between a G37 and G25.Plus, the deals people have been reporting on the G37 and G25 are not that much different from one another. The G37 is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the G37 then you are with the G25.The G25 basically serves the purpose of getting people into the Infiniti brand without too much bells and whistles about it. I still fee the G37 is a much better buy over the G25, obviously for the sport enthusiast as well."

Again, what's all this ""unreliable European car"" talk? I have owned many European cars over the years and didn't find them any more or less reliable than any other car. And how does the S60 have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? And again, why do you think the S60 is tight?

4941,fedlawman,"January 18, 2011 9:24PM","Personally, I think the G25 is being targeted at IS250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females looking to enter the ""luxury"" market. These buyers don't care about HP or manual transmissions. They're looking for styling and amenities.The TSX belongs here because, with the 6MT at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive cars in this category. I actually think it epitomizes the ELLPS segment right now. If you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. I have driven very few cars where every part is in harmony with every other part. The engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. It's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. It's like a symphony - seriously. I'll always remember mine as one of my favorites."

I thought the total package was much better overall than the MINI Cooper S (6MT) I test drove before it.  I love how the suspension is tuned.  I'm a die hard manual transmission guy & actually really like the way our TSX's automatic performs.  Upshifts are smooth & crisp.  Downshifts come when you want them too.  Driving in M mode, the transmission WILL NOT upshift at the redline unless you select the next gear.  It is also the most ENTRY LEVEL of the ELLPS.  You can seriously own a TSX Tech for under $30K.  Nobody else in this segment can touch that price."

You know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated seats, climate control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors, power seat and memory, those kind of things.  So most Japanese ones qualify even if it's G37 or IS350, but not the German ones because they are too expensive.  I would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too."

I have not driven the new tsx but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy - but performance in the current model do not match prev generations as this car has become a little bloated.  The base sonada comes with 200 hp and you can get a 275hp turbo 4 for 25k that gets 33mpg highway- you would love to see acura ""advance"" a bit before the whole line becomes saab or volvo."

If the car put the power down via the rear wheels and had a 2 or 2.5 litre diesel I'd keep it until they put me in a home.As it is, I still haven't seen anything I like enough better to go for it.  A Jetta or Golf TDI are possibilities, but I really enjoy the stone solid reliability of a Honda product.The transmission clicks nicely into each gear and is certainly the best one I've used since my MGB.  Even though the B's tansmission lacked a synchronized first gear, the linkage had absolutely zero play in it and sat right on top of the transmission -- good times.  The two Miatas and the 240Z I drove many miles had lots of good features, but the transmissions weren't the equal of the TSX or the B."

4962,saratoga3,"January 10, 2011 11:34AM","group,just wondering if anyone out there has looked at the Nissan Maxima? I have expanded my serach from Lexus and Infiniti and would appreciate any comments."
4963,smarty666,"January 11, 2011 6:44AM","Unlike pleko, I can give a better balanced impression on the Maxima since I have the new one and considered it heavily against the G37. There is plenty of reason to buy a Maxima and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your looking for specifically.If you don't have a family or a big family and want something with a luxury bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/handling then the G37 is the one that makes the most sense.If your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport look/flair to it then the Maxima fits the bill better. The maxima is much more comfortable inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel, power rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front seats, auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket seats, and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the G37.To me, the Maxima is the best handling FWD sedan I have ever driven to date. Its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the CVT. Only thing is, if you've never had a CVT before, it's going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. It was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and I have had zero problems with it in almost 17 miles.This gen max is a world's different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body style then the G37 does but that vehicle itself is due for a redesign in 2012. I suggest you test drive both vehicles, like I did, and see which one suits your needs better. They are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe."
4964,plekto,"January 11, 2011 8:06AM","What got me was that the Maxima is only 3 inches longer than the G37 size-wise.  It's mostly sheet metal.  FWD and CVT makes it frankly into an Avalon or Lucerne clone - it's nice and spacious, but it has a serious problem competing with the big RWD luxury cars."
4965,fedlawman,"January 11, 2011 8:38AM",Have you driven the Hyundai Genesis? You really should.
4966,smarty666,"January 11, 2011 4:13PM","Nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is NO one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. So you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. Now that Nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here."
4967,smarty666,"January 11, 2011 4:28PM","I don't need to be chastised b/c you don't agree with my assessment but I have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. Your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. This coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. I test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a G as a loaner many times when my FX was in for routine maintenance.I actually agree with you that the Maxima is not a true 4DSC in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but Nissan's stupid marketing schemes which they still don't get but that is another subject. I don't think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c I sure as didn't say it was. It is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan.Your comments tell me that you don't have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the Maxima is not the same price as a G37. As I stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded Maxima. Typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all said and done, while a G37 does not have as big of a reduction. I have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. That's still a difference and price and there are many luxury sedan features your getting in the cheaper Maxima that you can't even get in the G sedan even loaded all the way up.Is the fit and finish the same as the G, of course not, but it doesn't pale in comparison as you claim it to be. Its the best interior Nissan has had on the Maxima ever and that says a lot considering the interior's they had pre 2007.I was worried that there wouldn't be a market for the new Max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. There are big differences between the Altima and Maxima now that warrants the higher price of the Max and its more refined in every way, I should know, I cross-shopped that as well with the Maxima. As I said, the Maxima has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the power.Now if Infiniti ever decided to bring back a FWD sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value."
4968,smarty666,"January 11, 2011 6:24PM","Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does.Problem with you logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder. Its the sportiness for the competition in the market place it has right NOW.Is it has sporty as it used to be, no, but there is more than just a smidgen of sportiness left. The body style screams sport, the exhaust note screams sport, the acceleration is incredible, ride quality is definitely not Lexus cushy and gear toward the feedback side, and for FWD, it handles very responsively compared to the other FWD flagship sedans it competes with.I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong, especially if you compared it to the big/bloaty boat the previous generation was and sales failure it was. This generation at least started going back in the right direction after where it had been from 2004-2008. It blends family sedan comfort with some sporty driving characteristics. Something that both the Altima and G37 do not both due at the same time. The G37 is complete sports car while the Altima is a boring comfortable family sedan. The Maxima bridges some of the characteristics of each of those cars nicely."
4969,jimbres,"January 11, 2011 6:45PM","Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does.If you go back & read Shipo's post, you'll note that nowhere in it did he say that the Maxima isn't a strong seller - only that it's no longer considered a sport sedan as it once was.Problem with you[sic]logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder.I don't see a problem with Shipo's logic here. If the Maxima's chief competition comes from cars that aren't perceived as sporty, then it would logically follow from that fact that the Maxima itself is not perceived as sporty.I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrongOnce again, Shipo's argument doesn't rest on sales numbers."
4970,smarty666,"January 11, 2011 7:08PM","I never said the Maxima was a sports sedan. I said it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive characteristics.Actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others said that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. Sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldn't buy it in the numbers that they are.Second, saying that b/c the Maxima's chief competition come from cars that are not sporty thus making the Maxima itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isn't logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain characteristics then others. That's what makes test driving so important since the Maxima is very different with its driving dynamics then the others in the mainstream flagship class. That is the class the Maxima is in now, and it competes extremely well. I don't care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. Have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.Take the entry-level lux class for instance. An  ES350, C-Class, IS, A4 and Lacrosse are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the 3-Series and G37 are the polar opposite of that. That would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan  vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or luxury focus vehicles) they are not sport sedans as well. That of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a Maxima not having sporty driving characteristics."
4971,smarty666,"January 12, 2011 6:40AM","If you had read the posts from the last day you would have seen that I had mentioned I had gotten a Maxima. I was trying to offer advice and information for the OP who wanted to know the difference between the G37 and Maxima since he was considering the two vehicles.Since I have the new Max and I test drove and weighed it heavily against the G37, I thought I could provide some valuable insight into the differences between the two vehicles since I made a similar decision and what the pros and cons of each vehicle was. That is what I tried to do.Instead, I got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it :confuse:  Very puzzling statements considering its sales numbers and how the market/class segment it now occupies has changed very much from what it was 10-15 years ago."

That's about all that's left.As for the VW/Audi comparison, it depends which models.  He obviously thinks that the A4 is too small, so the next size larger, well there IS a VW that uses the A3 platform but is between the A4 and A6 in size (ie - the Passat)   While they aren't literal clones, they share so much DNA and parts they might as well be fighting over who gets the china in the estate sale.I'd certainly not pay Audi prices without looking at the Passat first."
4977,edwardsf,"November 5, 2010 2:45PM","I just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a CPO. Kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly.  Also, I never felt it was my car  ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ).But leasing a CPO is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of changeBTW, I think the BMW CPO is not quite as good as you have it described.  When the new car warranty ends the CPO begins.  It is consecutive, not cumulative.  So, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a CPO car, the new car warranty ended at 50k.  So you only get 2 years or 40k miles of CPO - whatever is less.I think you pay $50 when you take it in for CPO repairs.  Also, the CPO also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car.

You still have to do some digging & not just take the dealer's word for it as all CPOs are not created equal.  Some dealers look at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others.  Check into the service records.  Is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction?  One poster on the X3 board (from AZ I think) test drove a CPO X3 that he felt wasn' up to snuff.  Something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the X3 in CA I think.  You still are buying a used car.From a ""deal"" standpoint, leasing a CPO car doesn't make sense.  For the simple reason that no 2 CPO cars are alike.  The dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors.  It isn't like leasing new where there is a November program and the lease rate on every 2011 335i w/ X drive sedan is 0.XXXX or residual is XX%.  There are just way too many variables that the dealer controls that you as a consumer don't have access to.  Even the asking prices are arbitrary.  You could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5K off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.Free Scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes BMW stand out.  Yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isn't technically free.  But however they do it, it makes sense.  Now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove BMWs practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their cars to the dealer for service.BMWs 1st service comes at around 15K miles.  Gets you an oil change.Now my wife has a 2010 Acura TSX.  I had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (Synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles).  I think it was a little over $100 with a tire rotation.Service #2 which is technically the 1st service is what I did at 4500 miles $100+.I did at 10,000 miles.Service #3 I did at 20,000 miles and I specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.Many of Acura's ""services"" they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.BMW's 2nd service is an Inspection I service which is a major service at around 30K miles.Sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need brakes and rotors on your 3 series.  At least the fronts.  My parents had to have this done on my Mom's '08 328xi also right after the odometer said 50K and it was $700.They also recently had an Inspection II done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear brakes - $900.No it it almost isn't fair to compare the TSX to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the  segment.But take your run of the mill car that's sitting on the luxury dealer's lot which in CT/NY/NJ means AWD, Automatic, Premium Pkg, Cold Weather Pkg, NAV and the sticker prices(328i w/ X Drive, C300 SPort 4 Matic, IS250 AWD, CTS4, A4 2.0T Premium, G37X)  can't be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion.  The MSRPs on ALL these cars are north of $40,000."
4979,sweendogy,"November 27, 2010 1:52PM",i agree with car guy--i bot a new G 3.5 years ago now and for close to 40k -- lot of money over 3 years -- 2 weeks ago for my wife we got a 2007 cr-v -(dont laugh) but the 2010s were over 30k fully loaded - her 2007 saved me 12k from new is certified by honda and has only 19k miles on it.. we were also able to pick and choose the one we wanted (just like new) and as a second car it was a no brainer.
4980,sweendogy,"November 27, 2010 5:35PM","smarty i would of guessed the germans (certainly bmw) would keep values-- i mean they lease more bmws then other cars in the group (my guess is the TL is prob second on the lease vs buy list) and the main reason is resale value-- prob part of the reason why bmw offered free oilchanges and other things to get people to lease a  car that costs over 45k..plus bmw could sell a 3 year old 3 series for over 30k.I would dissagree with you on your CPO diss- the CPO report includes past maintenance -(btw is this the same lot you talked about hyundai, in the TL chat?)  and if a car is certified i would wonder why bmw/audi/ infiniti would sell a car that was not properly cared for..certainly with whats going on with toyota and if there is data to say the car was not up to certification-- you think they want bad press for including a car that has not infact passed the 150 pt inspection.  Your talking about a 3 year old car that has less then 40k miles on it-- how bad is the leather?? does it have rips?? how they cared for it--come on -- if it has a rip the dealer fixes it. I have no idea where you are looking at CPO's (the same hyundai dealer ?)-- but you should look to see what reports on each car are avail before making such comments on ""MOST"" CPOS..Value yes -- lux name yes-- attraction yes.--  :shades:"
4981,smarty666,"November 27, 2010 6:56PM","you need to do more readings on resale values, the Japanese have always had a edge over that then the Germans; there is nothing wrong with that, heck the Germans retain value better than the American brand still so its all good whether you go Japanese or German in regards to resale value and depreciation. Check out ALG website for the residual value awards and you'll see Acura tops the list for the last 2 or 3 years I believe, several other sites list Acura as top for resale value followed closely by Lexus and Infiniti.I hate to break it to you but CPO does not include past maintenance; I've returned plenty of lease vehicles from different manufacturers over the years who did not even care to see my maintenance records so there is no possible way for them to know, when they act like that at lease return, how the car was maintained and I'm sorry, but I've seen plenty of 2, 3, and 4 year old CPO cars out on the stealers lots for sale with really bad interior care from the previous owners; some of the stealers do the bare minimum when they put the cars back out on the used car lot for sale, you want to know why ""ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MAKING MONEY, THEY ARE A BUSINESS""I'm talking about some scratches, rips, severe wrinkles, discoloring, etc on the leather/vinyl; this is noticeable, at least to a car guy like me who takes excessive care of his vehicles, maybe not to the common folk but to me; some of the interiors look like the leather is 7, 8, or 9 years old when its really only 3 or 4. You can tell when looking at a vinyl or leather interior whether its been kept up or not.Your naive if you think that all the stealers really do all that they say they do in their marketing ploys for CPO. They just make sure things work in the car and that nothing is broken, and they give the car a wash and wax before putting it out on the lot.And if you read what I said carefully, which you rarely do, I said the CPO's I HAVE SEEN, most had interiors that were very worn and not kept up!"

If your buying a 2-3 year old car you should expect a couple of scratches and minor wear-- its a used car..hello.I know they are in it to make money--But they come with a warranttee and the check list of things done with the car to make it a CPO-- including tires, breaks, whatever and if something is needed it should be fixed--and if the consumer is smart they can have the car checked out before its bought.Your right i sometimes zoneout when reading your longposts i'm sorry could be my OCD..but you have to admit your statements about all the cars you have seen i mean its pretty funny how you always have a story to discount the previous poster... all those cars with bad leather.. oh man"

4988,nyccarguy,"November 30, 2010 1:37PM","sanjaysdca - 20K on an '08 MDX?  You gotta get out and drive more my man.  We purchased my wife's 2010 TSX Tech at the end of August 2009 & she has over 24,000 miles on it already.  The leather, specifically the left side bolster on the driver's seat definitely shows some signs of premature wear.  Probably my one knock against the car (other than the fact that it isn't rear wheel drive & I'm not a fan of the electric power steering).I just built a handful of these ELLPS during my lunch break.  I configured each vehicle to the level of equipment on the TL SH AWD.  Even at this price point, value has to come into play somehow.  All cars have manual transmissions as I'd get.Acura TL SH AWD -                                                                             $43,445Infiniti G37S -                                                                                         $40,325Audi A4 2.0T Prestige (Metallic Paint, S Line Sport Package)      $45,250BMW 328i                                                                                             $45,150(Premium, Sport, Cold Weather, iPod, Sirius, Xenon, HK, Nav, Met Paint)BMW 335i                                                                                             $52,200(Cold Weather, Premium, Sport, Nav, HK, iPod, Sirius, Met Paint)The TL is deinitely the biggest car.  So if you want performance, plus room for 4 full sized adults, and a generous sized trunk,  the TL is your car.  I actually dig the styling of the TL in it's SH AWD guise.  It definitely has a presence about it on the road.  I love the lip spoiler on the back & the faux quad exaust.  The wheels look sharp.  It gets fantastic reviews & write ups.Your best bang for the buck in this segment is definitely the Infiniti.  That's a whole lot of horsepower for your just over $40K sticker.  They give BIG discounts on these too.I think the A4 is a nice looking car, but am not sure if a 4 cyl cuts the mustard with it's $45K price tag.  I know it is probably the best turbo 4 on the market, but it is still a 4.  Good amount of passenger room, nice sized trunk.Dynmanically, the BMWs are the best.  Nothing comes close to the way a 3 series drives.  $52K is a lot of money for a car the size of a Honda Civic.  $45K is a lot to ask of a 230 hp car.  I know it isn't about straightline acceleration & 0-60 mph times."

Since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs?I'd take a look at the domestics as well (I actually liked the CTS...coupe looks very nice too)...go drive a CTS, LaCrosse, SHO...even go drive an MKS and see...of course if you 'know' you're not going to buy one then I suppose you're just waisting your time (I was surprised).If you're not keen on domestics how about the European?

If your looking for the true sport sedan feel you won't get that completely with the Max due to the CVT/FWD but it definitely has got a more sport oriented handling and power. I ended up with one b/c like you did not want a G37 due to the cramped feeling when in it. The Max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body style, and you get certain features you normally can only get in luxury sedans if you get the premium packages. The leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k.If that doesn't fit your bill, I would check out the Genesis but again, some people don't like the Hyundai name plate.Not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, I would check out the new M and 5 Series as well.

It's positioned in Europe as a BMW 5 series competitor at a lot less money.Here in UK, the BMW 5's run from £31k for the 523i SE to around £50k for the 550i SE, with lots of diesels.  The Cadillac CTS runs from £27k for the 2.8 V6 thro' £30k for the 3.6 V6 to £56k for the 6.2 V8, (though who would buy that beats me).  CTS is generally compared unfavourably to BMW/Merc/Jag/Audi due to poor ride/handling, (our roads aren't great), and having no diesel options..............a very big points loser !Not sure I've ever seen one on the road.The Mazda 6 runs from £16k for the 1.8 S through to £23k for the 2.2D Sport Estate, (wagon).
